      "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the inhibitory effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on virulence factors of Proteus mirabilis, a primary agent in catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The antimicrobial efficacy of EGCG was evaluated using the microdilution method, and the presence of biofilms and crystal formation were visualized using Gram staining and microscopy. Biochemical assays were performed to assess the inhibitory effects of EGCG on urease and hemolysin production. Swarming motility, a key determinant of bacterial colonization and spread, was evaluated using specialized swarming assays. Furthermore, the modulation of virulence-related gene expression by EGCG was quantitatively analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR, providing insights into its molecular mechanisms of action. EGCG exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration of 94\u2005\u03bcg/mL against P mirabilis, with a minimum bactericidal concentration of 188\u2005\u03bcg/mL. EGCG significantly inhibited bacterial growth and hindered biofilm formation, and its inhibitory effect was positively correlated with EGCG concentration. EGCG markedly suppressed urease, hemolysin, and swarming motility, leading to notable reduction in crystal production. Furthermore, EGCG significantly downregulated the expression of virulence genes including flhB, flhD, speA, luxS, ureR, hpmA, and hpmB. EGCG demonstrated multifaceted inhibitory effects against P mirabilis, including growth, biofilm formation, crucial enzyme production, swarming motility, and inhibition of key virulence genes. These findings establish a robust experimental foundation for utilizing EGCG to treat infections induced by P mirabilis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a significant clinical challenge, traditionally managed with long-term antibiotic prophylaxis. However, growing concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance have necessitated the exploration of alternative treatment modalities. Methenamine hippurate (MH), a urinary antiseptic with a unique mechanism of action, has emerged as a promising non-antibiotic option for rUTI prevention. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the effectiveness of MH in the prophylaxis of rUTI, with a specific focus on patients with structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and those requiring catheterization to empty their bladder. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on the first 150 patients prescribed MH in a University Hospital at a Local Health Board in South Wales from April 2020 to July 2022. Patient demographics, radiological findings, functional urological status, catheter use, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Chi-square statistical tests were used to assess associations between categorical variables and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 132 females (88%) with a median age of 60 years. After 12 weeks of treatment, 100 (66.7%) of patients showed improvement, with about half of these (n = 46) experiencing complete resolution of UTIs and a further third (n = 35) reporting reduced frequency or severity at six months follow-up. No statistically significant difference in long-term outcomes was observed based on radiological findings (\u03c72 = 0.138, df = 2, p = 0.933). Similarly, there was no significant association between functional urological status and treatment outcome (\u03c72 = 4.763, df = 2, p = 0.092), nor between catheter use and outcome (\u03c72 = 4.226, df = 2, p = 0.121) Conclusions: MH demonstrates effectiveness for long-term management of rUTIs across diverse patient populations, including those with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities and catheter users. These findings support the broader application of MH as a viable alternative to antibiotic prophylaxis, potentially reducing antimicrobial resistance while maintaining clinical efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Infection is one of the 2 most common complications associated with cesarean delivery. The principal infections, in descending order of frequency, are endometritis (organ space infection), wound infection (surgical site infection and incisional infection), and urinary tract infection. The major microorganisms that cause endometritis are anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, aerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. The principal pathogens that cause wound infections are the organisms listed above plus the staphylococcal and streptococcal organisms that colonize the skin of the patient's abdomen, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The dominant uropathogens are the aerobic Gram-negative bacilli Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus species. Group B streptococci, enterococci, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus are less common, but still important, uropathogens. The principal risk factors for endometritis and wound infection are obesity, extended duration of labor and ruptured membranes, multiple vaginal examinations after membrane rupture, internal fetal monitoring, smoking, insulin-dependent diabetes, immunosuppressive disorders, use of immunosuppressive medications, extended duration of surgery, and excessive intraoperative blood loss. The key risk factors for urinary tract infection are the technique for insertion of the urinary catheter and the duration of bladder catheterization. The initial differential diagnosis of postoperative fever includes endometritis, lower respiratory tract infection, and acute pyelonephritis. When postoperative fever persists, the differential must be broadened to include resistant microorganism(s), wound infection, pelvic abscess, septic pelvic vein thrombophlebitis, retained products of conception, drug fever, and reactivation of connective tissue disease. The appropriate antibiotic therapy for endometritis is either a combination regimen, such as clindamycin plus gentamicin or metronidazole plus ampicillin plus gentamicin, or single agents such as extended-spectrum penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems that provide coverage against the broad range of pelvic pathogens. For wound infection, the addition of a specific antistaphylococcal antibiotic such as vancomycin or linezolid, and, in some instances, surgical drainage are indicated. For a lower urinary tract infection, the oral antibiotics, nitrofurantoin monohydrate macrocrystals or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, are preferred. For pyelonephritis, ceftriaxone is an excellent choice for therapy. Several measures are of great value in reducing the frequency of endometritis and wound infection: preoperative antibiotics, clipping (rather than shaving) the hair at the incision site, preparation of the skin with chlorhexidine (rather than povidone-iodine), removal of the placenta by traction on the cord (rather than by manual extraction), closure of the deep subcutaneous layer if it exceeds 2 cm in thickness, and closure of the skin with a thin monofilament suture (rather than with staples or with a multifilament suture). The key preventive measures for reducing the frequency of urinary tract infection are strict aseptic technique in inserting the catheter and removal of the catheter within 12 to 24 hours of surgery. This review focuses primarily on the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of endometritis, wound infection, and urinary tract infection. It also provides a brief overview of the diagnosis and management of the potentially very serious complications that may arise from the original infection at the operative site, namely pelvic abscess, septic pelvic vein thrombophlebitis, and septic shock. The review concludes with a summary of key measures to prevent postoperative infections.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Early bedside tools that flag non-response in hospitalized adults with lower urinary tract infection (UTI) could align clinical care with antimicrobial stewardship. We evaluated REACT-UTI, a 72 h composite combining C-reactive protein (CRP) clearance \u226535%, defervescence (temperature < 37.5 \u00b0C), and \u22652-point symptom improvement, to predict early non-response and hospital length of stay (LOS), and we assessed modifiable processes of care. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of adults with culture-confirmed lower UTI (n = 126) admitted to a tertiary hospital in Timi\u0219oara (December 2023-August 2025). The primary outcome was 72 h early clinical response (ECR) defined by REACT-UTI. Multivariable logistic regression examined associations of catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI), time-to-effective therapy, baseline CRP, diabetes, early catheter removal/exchange (\u226448 h), and early intravenous-to-oral switch (\u226472 h) with non-response. Results: Overall, 76/126 patients (60.3%) achieved ECR. Non-responders more often had CAUTI, higher baseline CRP, longer time-to-effective therapy, ESBL or fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacterales, and longer LOS (14.1 vs. 9.8 days; p < 0.001). Adjusted models showed that CAUTI, delayed active therapy, higher baseline CRP, and diabetes increased the odds of non-response, whereas early catheter removal (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-0.9) and early IV-to-oral switch (aOR 0.4, 0.2-0.8) were protective. Greater CRP clearance correlated with shorter LOS (\u03c1 = -0.52; p < 0.001). Conclusions: In this single-center setting with a high burden of antimicrobial resistance, REACT-UTI at 72 h identified patients at risk of early non-response and prolonged hospitalization and highlighted actionable levers-timely active therapy, catheter management, and early oral step-down. External validation in diverse settings is needed before broader implementation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a major healthcare-associated infection (HAI) in trauma care settings, contributing to morbidity, mortality and antimicrobial resistance. In this study we characterize the epidemiology, microbiological profile, antimicrobial resistance patterns, and clinical outcomes of CAUTIs and non-CAUTI urinary tract infections (UTIs) at a Level 1 Trauma Centre in India from 2017 to 2024, using a modified CDC-NHSN definition and digital surveillance. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 723 UTI events was conducted using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHSN) definitions, modified to include Candida spp. at \u2265\u2009105 CFU/mL. Surveillance was performed by dedicated Hospital Infection Control Nurses (HICNs) using a digital system. Microbiological identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) were conducted via the conventional manual methods and automated systems. RESULTS: of 723 UTI events, 608 (84.0%) were CAUTIs. The cohort had a median age of 34 years (IQR:22-45) and was 76% male. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.9%), and Escherichia coli (15%) were predominant pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance was high, with 100% resistance to ceftazidime in Acinetobacter baumannii and 93.6-94.1% resistance to ciprofloxacin in Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus spp. Mortality was 25.5% (28.2% in CAUTI, 12.9% in non-CAUTI). CONCLUSION: This large-scale, trauma specific study with modified fungal criteria and digital surveillance highlights the importance of CAUTI burden and the high resistance in pathogens causing this infection.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) arise in patients with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract or those with nonurogenital comorbidities. cUTIs can be associated with high healthcare resource utilization (HCRU). We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to understand the economic burden of cUTI in a selection of countries likely to have early adoption of innovative antibiotic combination regimens. METHODS: The SLR was conducted to identify observational studies evaluating the burden of cUTI in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, China, Japan, and the United States (US) for 2013-2023 (PROSPERO-CRD42023454794) using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and EconLit databases, with no language limitations. RESULTS: Of 1,041 studies identified, 154 from databases were selected for full-text review; of these, 53 met the economic inclusion criteria, reporting direct costs and/or healthcare utilization. Mean hospitalization costs per cUTI varied from $2,747 in China to $32,790 for catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) acquired in the hospital among US children. Length of stay (LOS) was the most common HCRU outcome reported. Across 3 multicountry studies, LOS for cUTI hospitalization was similar, with a median length of 7 days. Patients with CAUTI had longer LOS than did controls. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence from the US studies indicates that economic burden associated with cUTI is substantial. However, except for the US, direct costs were missing or reported in only 1 or 2 studies for each of the other countries examined. Similarly, HCRU outcomes were missing or reported in only a few studies, except for the US and Spain.",

METHODS: A total of 580 BPH patients who underwent TUPKP between October 2016 and October 2022 were included as the modeling group, and 115 patients treated from November 2022 to November 2024 formed the validation group. Patients were classified into UTI and non-UTI groups based on the occurrence of UTI within 1 month postoperatively. Clinical data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors. A nomogram was constructed using R software, and its performance was assessed with ROC and calibration curves. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative UTI in the modeling group was 14.83%. Compared with the non-UTI group, the UTI group had significantly higher age, diabetes prevalence, preoperative catheterization, and routine nursing ratio, along with longer operation and catheterization times, and shorter antibiotic use duration (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR=1.061), diabetes (OR=1.889), operation time (OR=1.063), and indwelling catheter time (OR=1.912) were independent risk factors (P<0.05). The nomogram demonstrated good discrimination (AUC=0.825, 95% CI: 0.780-0.869) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.390). External validation showed similar performance (AUC=0.818, 95% CI: 0.711-0.925) with good consistency. CONCLUSION: Age, diabetes, duration of surgery, and postoperative indwelling catheter time are risk factors for urinary tract infection in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia undergoing TUPKP. The constructed nomogram model demonstrates good discrimination and consistency.",

Candida is the most common fungal genus causing urinary infections, representing a significant medical challenge, particularly in patients undergoing prolonged catheterization-a risk factor that exacerbates clinical conditions by promoting the formation of resistant biofilms. In this context, the coating of catheters with antimicrobial substances combined with drug repositioning is an innovative alternative. In this study, we evaluated the activity of promethazine (PMT), a first-generation antihistamine, against the formation of Candida spp. biofilms on urinary catheter fragments. Broth microdilution, impregnation of urinary catheter fragments, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were the exploratory techniques employed. PMT proved to be an effective agent in inhibiting biofilm formation, achieving a 50% reduction in colony-forming units (CFU/mL). The results indicated that PMT exhibits high potential as an antifungal agent, with promising applications in coatings aimed at preventing Candida spp. infections associated with long-term urinary devices.",

There is a shortage of comprehensive data addressing the current prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, and associated risk factors in clinically suspected UTI patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence, bacterial profile, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and associated risk factors for urinary tract infection among clinically suspected patients. METHOD: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1, 2023, to November 30, 2023, in patients clinically suspected of having a UTI. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using structured questionnaires. A total of 320 patients were enrolled, and a systematic random sampling technique was used to select the studyparticipantsApproximately 5 to 10\u2009ml of morning midstream urine was collected and inoculated primarily on the CLED agar. Thereafter, the isolates were subculture on Blood agar and MacConkey media for identification. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used to determine the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing strains were detected using combined disk and modified carbapenem inhibition test methods, respectively. The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 27 software. A p value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Of the total participants, 212 (66.25%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 35.99\u2009\u00b1\u200917.17\u2009years. The prevalence of UTIs was 21.9%. A total of 70 different bacterial isolates were recovered. Of these, 58 (82.9%) and 12 (17.1%) were gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates, respectively. Among the gram-negative bacteria,E.coli isoltes was 34 (58.6%) predominant, followed by K. pneumoniae 22 (37.9%) and P. mirabilis 2 (3.5%), while S. aureus 9 (75%) was prevalent among the gram-positive isolates. Meropenem and nitrofurantoin are effective antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria.The prevalence of multidrug resistance was 71.4%. Approximately 27 (46.6%) and 4 (6.9%) gram-negative isolates were found to be extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemase producers, respectively. A history of UTI, catheterization, HIV, and diabetes were independent risk factors associated with UTI (p\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of UTIs among clinically suspected patients was high, with increased positivity rates for MDR, ESBL and CP-producing strains. Patients with UTI should have a critical need for appropriate antimicrobial administration and the practice of providing patients with suitable antibioticsAntibiotic should be prescribed based on results obtained from the laboratory diagnosis of AST and complying with local guidelines by considering the most often domestically isolated organisms.",

This study determined the prevalence of candiduria, the species ofCandida and factors that predict the presence of candiduria among hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections (UTI). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 220 consenting hospitalized adult patients with UTI at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Oyo State from April 2020 - January 2021. Urine samples were examined microscopically, cultured on supplemented Sabouraud dextrose agar andCandida species were identified by microscopy, germ tube test and CHROMagar Candida. Chi-square test was used to identify factors associated with candiduria. RESULTS: The age range of participants was 18-80 years (mean 44.5\u00b119 years) while the male to female ratio was 1:1.4. About 80% had a history of recent antibiotics, 26% were on catheter, and 3.2% were known diabetics. The prevalence of candiduria was 16.4% and the most common species of Candida wasC. albicans (83%), while the others wereC. krusei. Candiduria was significantly higher (p<0.05) among patients with history of antibiotic use, indwelling urinary catheter, prolonged catheterization and surgical procedures while the elderly age, long duration of admission, and male gender had higher prevalence, but no statistically significant associations. CONCLUSION: Candiduria among this population is high and associated mostly with antibiotics use, catheterization, long duration of catheter use and surgical procedures. In addition to limiting antibiotic consumption, urethral catheterization and its duration, we recommend that patients with UTI who are at high risk of developing candiduria should be assessed for its presence to identify those who will benefit from treatment.",

      "abstract": "Purple Urine Bag Syndrome (PUBS) is an uncommon but notable clinical phenomenon primarily observed in patients with long-term indwelling catheters. This syndrome is characterized by a striking purple discoloration of the urine collection bag, often indicative of an underlying urinary tract infection (UTI) and associated metabolic processes. PUBS occurs due to the breakdown of indoxyl sulfate, a tryptophan metabolite, by specific bacteria present in the urinary tract. In this report, we present the case of a 73-year-old female with a chronic Foley's catheter, later developed PUBS, accompanied by symptoms of lower abdominal pain, fever, and reduced urine output. Urine culture identified Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common uropathogen, as the causative organism. This case highlights the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and management of PUBS in a patient with long-standing catheterization, along with a brief review of existing literature on the condition. Prompt recognition and targeted antibiotic therapy, alongside supportive measures, were essential in managing the infection and alleviating symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a severe, rare urinary tract infection (UTI) primarily affecting patients with diabetes or compromised immune function. Characterized by nonspecific manifestations including fever, flank pain, and pyuria, it frequently overlaps with other renal or abdominal conditions, leading to diagnostic delays and increased mortality risk. Notably, EPN following retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) - a minimally invasive technique for renal and ureteral stone management - is extremely rare, with no prior documented cases in the literature. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old Chinese man was admitted on May 15, 2024 due to a >3-cm right ureteropelvic junction stone, multiple right renal stones, and concurrent right renal hydronephrosis. Preoperative urine culture identified Klebsiella aerogenes and Citrobacter koseri, prompting 9 days of perioperative levofloxacin (500 mg/day), which cleared the infection. Despite guideline recommendations for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, he opted for RIRS, undergoing first-stage surgery with double-J catheter placement on May 24 and discharging uneventfully on May 27. On postoperative day 10 (June 3), he developed a 39\u00b0C fever and persistent abdominal pain. CT confirmed Grade 1 EPN, ureteral steinstrasse, and persistent hydronephrosis. Urgent percutaneous nephrostomy, catheter replacement, and 11-day ertapenem therapy (1g/day) controlled the infection, and a second RIRS on June 12 cleared the stones, with no complications in 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Post-RIRS fever/abdominal pain requires urgent imaging to rule out steinstrasse-induced EPN. Early drainage, targeted antibiotics, and staged RIRS are critical for elderly patients with high stone burden, filling the literature gap on this complication.",

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 237 patients with spinal cord injury who were either currently performing or had previously performed IC at a tertiary-level rehabilitation center. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were collected using a descriptive information form and the Functional Independence Measure. RESULTS: IC was continued by 89.9% of the study participants, and discontinued by 10.1%. Higher adherence was observed in male patients and those with complete injuries (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Of those who continued IC, the rates of \"use of bladder/sphincter relaxants in the last four weeks\" and \"use of antibiotics/antiseptics for UTI in the past year\" were significantly higher compared to those who discontinued IC (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The most common reasons for discontinuation were individual decision (33.3%) and physician recommendation (29.2%). Patients who stopped IC preferred voiding (normal or reflex) (58.3%), indwelling catheterization (25%), or the use of diapers/pads (16.7%). The majority of patients who discontinued IC did so within the first year of use. CONCLUSION: The decision to continue IC is influenced by individual, clinical, and environmental factors. These findings highlight the necessity of personalized education, follow-up, and support programs to enhance long-term adherence to IC.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common complications in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) and multiple sclerosis (MS), especially those using intermittent catheterization (IC) for neurogenic bladder management. These infections impact quality of life and place a burden on healthcare systems. This study aimed to provide a preliminary estimate of the burden and management of UTIs in SCI and MS patients across Italian healthcare settings. METHODS:: A structured survey, developed and validated by an expert panel, was distributed to clinicians from various Italian centers. It collected information on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, risk perception, and prevention strategies for UTIs in tetraplegic/paraplegic SCI and MS patients. The economic impact was estimated using the ABC methodology, considering resource utilization, antibiotic use, diagnostic tests, and management of adverse events. RESULTS:: Survey data revealed a variability across centers. UTIs affected 75.0% of tetraplegic and 67.5% of paraplegic patients during post-trauma hospitalization, and 45.7% of MS patients. Mean hospital stay was longer for tetraplegic (137.3 days) than paraplegic patients (99.1 days). First-line antibiotic choices differed widely, and second-line treatments were required in 47.1% of SCI and 28.4% of MS cases. The estimated mean cost of UTI management was \u20ac 1,141.59 for tetraplegic, \u20ac 979.85 for paraplegic, and \u20ac 850.37 for MS patients. CONCLUSION:: This study offers an initial overview of the clinical and economic burden of UTIs in SCI and MS patients in Italy, revealing significant heterogeneity in management. Limitations include the small sample size and the reliance on clinicians\u2019 perceptions rather than real-world data.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the annual variation in pathogen distribution, clinical characteristics, and associated risk factors of neonatal urinary tract infections (UTIs), providing a scientific basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from 134 neonatal UTI cases admitted to our hospital between January 2021 and December 2024. The distribution of pathogens, bacterial resistance patterns, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were compared in different years. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify risk factors associated with neonatal UTIs. RESULTS: (1) Among the 134 pediatric patients, 86 were male and 48 were female; 52 (38.8%) were preterm, while 82 (61.2%) were full-term. The incidence rates of UTIs from 2021 to 2024 were 8.2%, 9.1%, 10.3%, and 11.2%, respectively, with a statistically significant difference across the years (P\u2009<\u20090.05). (2) The primary clinical manifestations included fever (72 cases, 53.7%), crying (65 cases, 48.5%), and poor feeding (58 cases, 43.3%). (3) From 2021 to 2024, the detection rate of Gram-negative bacteria exhibited a significant downward trend (75.8%, 70.3%, 65.1%, and 61.2%, P\u2009<\u20090.05), with Escherichia coli showing a yearly decline (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Conversely, the detection rate of Gram-positive bacteria demonstrated a significant upward trend (18.2%, 24.3%, 28.6%, and 32.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.05), with coagulase-negative staphylococci increasing annually (P\u2009<\u20090.05). (4) The detection rate of Gram-positive bacteria was significantly higher in the low birth weight group than in the normal birth weight group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). (5) The antibiotic resistance rates of E. coli and Enterococcus faecium showed a progressive increase over the study period (P\u2009<\u20090.05). (6) Multivariable analysis identified low birth weight (OR\u2009=\u20092.831, 95% CI: 1.562-5.121), indwelling urinary catheter (OR\u2009=\u20093.452, 95% CI: 1.891-6.282), and maternal infection during pregnancy (OR\u2009=\u20092.154, 95% CI: 1.233-3.762) as independent risk factors for neonatal UTIs. CONCLUSION: The incidence of neonatal UTIs shows a progressive upward trend in recent years, accompanied by a significant shift in pathogen spectra. Particular attention should be given to high-risk factors such as low birth weight and indwelling urinary catheters, necessitating targeted preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) account for 70%~80% of urinary tract infections (UTI) and can lead to adverse outcomes. Most CAUTIs are polymicrobial with resilient communities maintaining a consistent composition of species over time, despite antibiotic treatment and catheter replacement. However, the mechanisms promoting persistence are poorly understood. Here we examine how a chemical interaction between Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae can explain their high rate of co-occurrence on long-term indwelling urinary catheters. Sequence analyses of longitudinal isolates from several human patients co-infected with E. faecalis and K. pneumoniae revealed that despite frequent replacement, catheters became re-colonized with the same or a nearly identical consortium of strains throughout the study collection period. Using artificial urine medium (AUM), monoculture revealed that the K. pneumoniae isolates grew robustly and formed biofilm, while the E. faecalis isolates grew poorly and did not form biofilm. However, co-culture of paired isolates resulted in enhanced E. faecalis growth and biofilm, which could be reproduced by supplementing E. faecalis with cell-free K. pneumoniae conditioned AUM supernatant (KpAUMSup). Analyses using comparative transcriptomics, mutant strains and chemical inhibitors with cell culture and murine CAUTI models revealed that: i) KpAUMSup, but not AUM, stimulated expression of the E. faecalis Fsr quorum-sensing system; ii) Fsr was required for E. faecalis to respond to KpAUMSup; iii) E. faecalis cultured in KpAUMSup was more efficient in initiating CAUTI; and iv) Disruption of Fsr inhibited initiation of CAUTI. This interspecies signaling may help explain the high rate of co-colonization of these CAUTI pathogens and highlights new therapeutic strategies to treat polymicrobial CAUTI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI) frequently rely on urinary catheters to drain urine from the bladder, making them susceptible to asymptomatic and symptomatic catheter-associated bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTI). Current identification of these conditions lacks precision, leading to inappropriate antibiotic use, which promotes selection for drug-resistant bacteria. Since infection often leads to dysbiosis in the microbiome and correlates with health status, this study aimed to develop a machine learning-based diagnostic framework to predict potential UTI by monitoring urine and/or catheter microbiome data, thereby minimising unnecessary antibiotic use and improving patient health. RESULTS: Microbial communities in 609 samples (309 catheter and 300 urine) with asymptomatic and symptomatic bacteriuria status were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing from 27 participants over 18\u00a0months. Microbial community compositions were significantly different between asymptomatic and symptomatic bacteriuria, suggesting microbial community signatures have potential application as a diagnostic tool. A significant decrease in local (alpha) diversity was noted in symptomatic bacteriuria compared to the asymptomatic bacteriuria (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Beta diversity measured in weighted unifrac also showed a significant difference (P\u2009<\u20090.05) between groups. Supervised machine learning models were trained on amplicon sequence variant (ASVs) counts and bacterial taxonomic abundances (Taxa) to classify symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria with a repeated tenfold and leave-one-out participant (LOPO) type of cross-validation approaches. Combining urine and catheter microbiome data improved the model performance during repeated tenfold cross-validation, yielding a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.95 (95% CI 93-0.97) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.89) for ASVs and taxonomic features in the independent held-out test set, respectively. The LOPO cross-validation yielded a mean AUROC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.85-0.89) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.82) for ASVs and taxa features, respectively. These results suggest the potential of microbiome features in differentiating symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria states. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that signatures within catheter and urine microbiota could serve as tools to monitor the health status of SCI patients. Establishing a classification system based on these microbial signatures could equip physicians with alternative management strategies, potentially reducing UTI episodes and associated hospital costs, thus significantly improving patient quality of life while mitigating the impact of drug-resistant UTI.

This study aimed to compare the prevalence and trends of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales and CRE in patients with CAUTIs and non-CAUTIs. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 4262 UTI-positive urine cultures was conducted at King Fahad Hospital of the University, Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia (January 2022-November 2023). Demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were obtained from hospital records. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using the Vitek\u00ae System; ESBL and CRE were identified using Ezy MIC\u2122 strips and Xpert\u00ae Carba-R assay, respectively. Results: ESBL-producing Enterobacterales accounted for 11.3% of cases; CRE comprised 1.8%. ESBL was significantly more prevalent in non-catheterized patients and those in emergency care. CRE was significantly associated with catheterized patients and inpatient settings. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the predominant ESBL-producing and CRE isolates, respectively. bla-OXA-48 was the most frequently detected carbapenemase gene (66.7%). ESBL was prevalent in younger, non-catheterized females, suggesting increasing community transmission. Conversely, CRE were primarily observed in older, catheterized inpatients, emphasizing the role of invasive devices in resistance spread. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of targeted infection control and early catheter removal to mitigate resistance trends.",

      "abstract": "Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infections among kidney transplant recipients, with prevalence rates ranging from 12% to 75% in studies from North America and Australia and from 4.5% to 85% in the Middle East. These infections can significantly impact graft survival and patient quality of life, increasing the risk of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of UTIs in transplant patients, but multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens are a growing concern, especially in Saudi Arabia. Several factors, including advanced age, female gender, and use of urinary catheters, contribute to post-transplant UTIs. This study focuses on the Saudi population, aiming to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and treatment strategies for recurrent and multidrug-resistant UTIs in kidney transplant recipients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed the medical records of kidney transplant patients at King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Jeddah, in addition to data from King Fahad Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia, between March and May 2022. Adult patients (\u226518 years) who developed recurrent UTIs within two years post-transplant were included, while those with one or no UTI episode or incomplete records were excluded. Results: Seventy-five of 491 screened patients (15.3%) experienced recurrent UTIs, contributing to a total of 219 episodes. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen, isolated in 94 episodes (42.9%). Key risk factors for recurrence included complicated UTIs (OR = 4.60, p = 0.005), multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (OR = 3.14, p = 0.021), and ureteric stents (OR = 4.07, p = 0.042). Carbapenems were primarily used for complicated UTIs, while cephalosporins and penicillins were used for uncomplicated infections. A significant post-UTI rise in serum creatinine was observed (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Recurrent UTIs predominantly caused by K. pneumoniae are common in kidney transplant recipients, particularly in patients over 45, with multidrug-resistant organisms, or with ureteric stents. While a direct causal link to graft loss was not established, these infections can lead to increased creatinine levels, hospitalizations, and healthcare costs and increased carbapenem use. These findings highlight the critical need for institution-specific antimicrobial stewardship programs focused on infection prevention and optimized antibiotic use to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a persistent challenge in intensive care units (ICUs), further aggravated by Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). Although the World Health Organization (WHO) Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Framework (IPCAF) provides a standardized method to evaluate the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) capacity, limited data are available on its application in Italy and its association with HAI incidence in ICUs. This study aimed to assess IPC implementation within the Italian Nosocomial Infections Surveillance in Intensive Care Units' network (Sorveglianza Prospettica delle Infezioni Nosocomiali nelle Unit\u00e0 di Terapia Intensiva, SPIN-UTI) using the WHO IPCAF tool, analyze its relationship with HAI and process indicators, and identify key barriers to effective IPC practices. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 43 adult ICUs participating in the 2023 SPIN-UTI surveillance programme. Data on HAIs and IPC-related process indicators were collected alongside IPCAF assessments and a targeted survey on implementation barriers. Descriptive statistics, Spearman's correlation, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: IPCAF total scores, calculated for each ICU, ranged from 350.0 to 782.5 (median: 610.0), with 51.2% of ICUs achieving an advanced IPC level. The lowest scores were observed in education, monitoring, and multimodal strategies domains. Common barriers included inadequate human and financial resources. A significant inverse correlation was found between IPCAF scores and the number of reported barriers (\u03c1 = - 0.583; p\u2009<\u20090.001). No significant associations were found between IPCAF scores and HAI incidence, except for a positive correlation between HAI surveillance domain scores and central line-associated bloodstream infections rates (CLABSIs) (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.424; p\u2009=\u20090.016). Strong positive correlations emerged between IPCAF domains and key process indicators, such as antimicrobial stewardship, oral decontamination, and catheter care. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows substantial variability in IPC implementation across Italian ICUs and identifies key areas for improvement. While higher IPCAF scores correlate with better adherence to preventive practices, they do not directly predict HAI rates, possibly due to differences in surveillance sensitivity, lack of correlation with actual incidence, or the subjective nature of IPCAF responses. Strengthening education, staffing, monitoring and feedback systems is essential to enhance IPC effectiveness and patient safety.",

They exhibit multi-drug resistance (including AmpC) and often require combination therapy. This is the first study from Saudi Arabia to review infections by Brucella anthropi and Brucella intermedia, focusing on clinical significance, resistance, and outcomes. METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted on infections caused by B. anthropi and B. intermedia between January 2016 to December 2024. Data on patient demographics, infection type and location, microbial identification, and resistance patterns were collected. Treatment and therapy duration were reviewed, along with outcome assessment. Analysis of the rate of recovery and in-hospital mortality was performed. RESULTS: Over 8\u2009years, a total of 18 unique cases were identified, after excluding 2 of which were deemed contaminated, totaling 16 cases included, 14 adult and 2 pediatric patients were identified as true infections. Presentations varied between septic shock, respiratory distress, and/or altered mental status. Diagnoses included catheter-related bloodstream infections (n\u2009=\u20099), intra-abdominal infection with or without bacteremia (n\u2009=\u20094), and VAP in the neonate (n\u2009=\u20092), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) (n\u2009=\u20091). B. anthropi was found in eleven (11/16) cases, and B. intermedia in four cases, in addition to one that was not identified to species level. Twelve were monomicrobial (12/16, 75%) and six had polymicrobial growth. Resistance to cephalosporins and piperacillin/tazobactam was observed, but all isolates were susceptible to carbapenems, TMP/SMX, and ciprofloxacin. Three deaths (3/16) were documented, and the remaining thirteen patients survived, and the overall survival rate was 81%. CONCLUSION: B. anthropi and B. intermedia infections are rare overall, mostly identified in blood cultures with variable clinical presentation.

Abortus) is essential. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

      "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a causative pathogen of nosocomial catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), but prostate involvement, including prostatitis and prostatic abscess, is rare. The clinical characteristics of P. aeruginosa-associated CAUTI with prostatic lesions, as well as the contribution of genetic backgrounds remain unclear. We describe four cases of urinary catheter-associated prostatic infection caused by P. aeruginosa following postoperative catheterization. All patients developed fever within 10 days after surgery, and three of the four patients developed bacteremia. Three patients were diagnosed with prostatic abscess by contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, while one case presented with prostatitis without abscess formation. Prostate-specific antigen levels were elevated over 20 ng/mL in all three measured cases. All patients were treated successfully with prolonged antibiotic therapy (28-39 days) without surgical drainage. Notably, all three abscess cases were successfully managed with fluoroquinolone-based combination therapy, highlighting its potential role in the management of prostatic abscesses. Three of four isolates were submitted for molecular investigations. All isolates harbored exoT and exoY, whereas exoU was absent. Biofilm-associated genes were detected in two cases, but not in the remaining case. Our findings suggested that P. aeruginosa strains carrying T3SS genes (exoT and exoY) potentially develop prostatic infections, independent of biofilm-associated genes. Host and iatrogenic factors, such as catheter manipulation, may play more critical roles in the development of prostatic pathology than strain-specific determinants. Assessment of prostate-specific antigen levels and early imaging may facilitate appropriate diagnosis and effective management when P. aeruginosa is detected as a cause of CAUTI.",

      "abstract": "The escalating crisis of bacterial antimicrobial resistance poses a severe threat to global health, necessitating novel strategies beyond conventional antibiotics. Photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as a promising alternative that leverages heat generated by laser irradiation to induce localized cellular damage and eradicate bacteria. Among various photothermal agents, carbon-based nanomaterials like graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) offer exceptional properties for PTT applications. This study introduces a novel urinary catheter (UC) embedded with GNPs (GNPUC), specifically designed for photothermal sterilization to combat catheter-associated bacterial infections. GNPs were systematically incorporated into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) catheters at varying weight percentages (1% to 10%). The fabricated GNPUCs exhibited low wettability, hydrophobic characteristics, and low adhesiveness, properties that are crucial for minimizing bacterial interactions and initial adhesion. Upon exposure to near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.5 W/cm2), the UC containing 10 weight percent of GNPs (10GNPUC) achieved a significant temperature of 68.8 \u00b0C, demonstrating its potent photothermal conversion capability. Quantitative agar plate tests confirmed the enhanced, concentration-dependent photothermal antibacterial activity of GNPUCs against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Notably, 5% and higher GNP concentrations achieved 100% mortality of S. aureus, while 1% and higher concentrations achieved 100% mortality of E. coli. These findings underscore the significant potential of GNP-embedded catheters as a highly effective photothermal antibacterial platform for future clinical applications in combating catheter-associated infections.",

This study aimed to develop a machine learning classification model to predict the risk of high catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates based on SNF characteristics. Methods: We analyzed 94,877 total SNF-year observations from 2019 to 2024, not unique facilities; thus, individual SNFs may appear in multiple years. The factor variables were average length of stay in days, number of staffed beds, total nurse and total physical therapy staffing hours per resident per day, facility ownership, geographic classification, facility accreditation, Accountable Care Organization affiliations, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services SNF Overall Star Rating, and the SNF-year of the observations. We utilized three machine learning models for this analysis: Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. We used Shapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the best-performing machine learning model by visualizing feature importance and examining the relationship between key predictors and the outcome. Results: We found that machine learning models outperformed traditional logistic regression in predicting UTIs in skilled nursing facilities. Using the best-performing model, Random Forest, we identified rural SNFs, and the number of staffed beds as the most influential predictors of high UTI rates, followed by average length of stay, and geographic location. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the value of using facility-level characteristics to predict the risk of UTIs in SNFs with machine learning models. Results from this study can inform infection prevention efforts in post-acute care settings.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: International guidelines advocate obtaining urine cultures prior to antibiotic administration in hospitalized patients with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). However, adherence remains suboptimal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the positivity rate of urine cultures following a single empiric antibiotic dose and to identify factors associated with post-antibiotic culture positivity. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in an internal medicine ward between December 2019 and June 2024. Patients diagnosed with UTI who had both pre- and post-antibiotic urine cultures were included. Positivity rates of post-antibiotic urine cultures were assessed. Factors associated with culture positivity were examined using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included in the analysis (59% female; median age 79\u00a0years). Eighty-eight patients (67%) had a positive post-antibiotic urine culture. The positivity rate in patients with a sensitive and resistant uropathogen to the empirically administrated antibiotic was 58% and 100%, respectively. Independent predictors for urine culture positivity included older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.07, p\u2009=\u20090.007) and recent urinary catheter use in the last 30\u00a0days (aOR 14.7, CI 1.66-128, p\u2009=\u20090.016). Culture sampling more than 9\u00a0h after antibiotic administration was a negative predictor for culture positivity (aOR 0.41, CI 0.18-0.96, p\u2009=\u20090.041). CONCLUSION: Urine culture positivity remains high after a single antibiotic dose in hospitalized patients with UTI. In cases where pre-antibiotic urine cultures are missed, a timely post-antibiotic urine sampling remains clinically relevant for pathogen identification and appropriate antibiotic selection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Indwelling urinary catheters are widely used in hospitalized patients but can be inadvertently dislodged due to trauma, leading to complications such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections and urological injuries. CASE REPORT: An 87-year-old man developed a seminal vesicle abscess (SVA) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa following urethral injury due to accidental urinary catheter dislodgement. The patient presented with hematuria and penile bleeding following dislodgement of the urinary catheter, and subsequently developed fever and a urinary tract infection. Computed tomography revealed contrast enhancement in the left seminal vesicle and left testis, as well as emphysematous cystitis. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an abscess in the left seminal vesicle. Urine cultures identified P. aeruginosa as the causative organism. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin without the need for surgical drainage and was subsequently transferred to another facility. CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic urinary catheter removal increases the risk of urethral injury and infection; therefore, appropriate measures to prevent catheter dislodgement are essential. Additionally, in urinary tract infections following catheter-related urethral injury, the possibility of progression to an SVA should be considered. Early imaging-based diagnosis, targeted antibiotic therapy, and drainage, when necessary, are crucial for improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are among the most prevalent hospital-acquired infections, posing a serious clinical and economic burden, particularly in the context of rising antibiotic resistance. Biofilm formation on indwelling catheters by multidrug-resistant uropathogens further complicates treatment and prevention, underscoring the urgent need for alternative, non-antibiotic solutions. AREAS COVERED: This article explores the potential of bacteriophage- and enzybiotic-coated urinary catheters as an innovative strategy to prevent recurrent bacterial infections. We review the clinical significance of biofilm formation on the surface of urinary catheters, the role of phages and their lytic enzymes in disrupting biofilms, and the clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of phage therapy. The reference list was compiled through a structured search of peer-reviewed studies and case reports, particularly from recent years, available in the PubMed database. EXPERT OPINION: Phage- and enzybiotic-functionalized catheters represent a promising non-antibiotic approach to CAUTI prevention. These biological agents offer targeted antibacterial activity, disrupt biofilms, and reduce the risk of drug resistance development. Their integration into catheter design may significantly improve infection control, reduce antibiotic use, and align with global antimicrobial stewardship goals. However, clinical standardization and regulatory clarity are crucial for advancing their implementation in routine clinical practice.",

While ASB and CAUTI are caused by a broad range of uropathogens, most remain understudied. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the understudied uropathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. Analysis of 153 longitudinal S. aureus isolates previously collected from urinary catheter or urine samples from 20 individuals with LTUCs (average of 8 longitudinal isolates/person) demonstrated that most strains were multidrug resistant (MDR), including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and sequence type 5. Importantly, the same S. aureus strain persisted as ASB for an average of 13 weeks, despite antibiotic exposures or urinary catheter exchanges, and in one case transitioned to symptomatic CAUTI. The longitudinal strains were highly genetically related with few genomic changes and stable antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene carriage. This work demonstrates that MDR S. aureus can persist as ASB long-term and that common strategies to reduce or eliminate microbes from LTUCs were ineffective at eradicating the uropathogen in most cases, despite phenotypic susceptibility to the administered antibiotic.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of suprapubic catheter-associated bacteriuria (SPCAB) and multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) in patients with urethral strictures, and compare antimicrobial resistance patterns between pathogens isolated from urinary samples and suprapubic catheters. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with urethral strictures who had urethral reconstructive surgery with suprapubic catheters from January 2010 to June 2023. Clinical data, bacterial pathogens, and resistance patterns were collected. Heatmaps visualized resistance profiles. Descriptive statistics summarized demographics and perioperative variables; while binary logistic regression models were applied to identify independent risk factors for SPCAB and MDRB. RESULTS: Among 2809 urine samples, 42.6\u202f% yielded positive cultures. The predominant pathogens in SPCAB were Escherichia coli (18.8\u202f%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.9\u202f%). Common pathogens exhibited high antimicrobial resistance rates, mirroring patterns observed in suprapubic catheter isolates. Risk factors for SPCAB included duration after suprapubic cystostomy (OR=1.712, P\u202f=\u202f0.049), indwelling time of single catheter >15 days (OR=2.870, P\u202f=\u202f0.007), absence of catheter colonization (OR=0.079, P\u202f<\u202f0.001), and antibiotic use >7 days. For MDRB, significant risk factors comprised duration after suprapubic cystostomy (OR=2.014, P\u202f=\u202f0.009), indwelling time of single catheter >30 days (OR=2.541, P\u202f=\u202f0.019), absence of MDRB colonization (OR=0.079, P\u202f<\u202f0.001), and postoperative sampling. CONCLUSIONS: In managing urethral strictures with SPCs, our findings emphasize prioritizing perioperative strategies: early catheter replacement (\u226415-day intervals), empirical antimicrobial therapy guided by local resistance patterns. SPC culture-guided interventions may hold potential clinical value for mitigating SPCAB risks, though further validation is warranted.",

The aim of the study was to identify specific MDR-CAUTI risk factors and to compare outcomes between MDR and non-MDR infections. METHODS: Single centre, prospective, observational study, conducted between 2015 and 2022, including PICU patients with a microbiologically confirmed CAUTI. Demographical, clinical, and microbiological data and outcomes were compared among patients with and without MDR-CAUTI. RESULTS: Ninety-one CAUTI episodes were included, 32 (35.2%) caused by MDR microorganisms. In the univariate analysis, comorbidity (p\u2009=\u20090.010), previous antibiotic therapy (p\u2009=\u20090.003), first 48\u2009h antibiotic exposure (p\u2009=\u20090.005), PICU stay before CAUTI (p\u2009=\u20090.017), previous MDR colonisation (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and previous MDR infection (p\u2009=\u20090.002) were associated with MDR-CAUTI. In the multivariate analysis, previous colonisation (OR 6.056), previous MDR infection (OR 9.153), and first 48\u2009h antibiotic exposure (OR 3.029) were independently associated with MDR-CAUTI. Higher empirical treatment inappropriateness (39.3% vs. 7.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer stays were observed for MDR-CAUTI, without differences in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: MDR rates among CAUTI in PICU are concerning and can jeopardise empirical treatment success. Acknowledging risk factors for MDR-CAUTI is crucial to guide empirical antibiotic therapy.",

However, reports detailing intensive care management of TAFRO syndrome remain limited. A 65-year-old woman was diagnosed with TAFRO syndrome, presenting with progressive edema, significant pleural and ascitic effusions, thrombocytopenia, fever around 37.5-38\u00b0C, acute kidney injury, and Castleman disease-like features on lymph node biopsy. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management. Treatment included pulse steroid therapy, careful fluid management with frequent assessment of intravascular volume, and hemodialysis. As a result of pleural effusion drainage and high-flow nasal cannula therapy for respiratory failure due to massive pleural effusion, oxygenation and dyspnea improved, allowing for the avoidance of tracheal intubation. Antibiotics and vasopressors were administered to address septic shock caused by a catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).

Types of incontinence include stress (SUI), urge or overactive bladder (OAB), mixed, neurogenic, and overflow incontinence. First-line treatment for OAB and SUI is nonpharmacologic management. Behavioral therapy is first-line treatment for urge incontinence. Vaginal mechanical devices (cones, pessaries, and urethral plugs), pelvic floor muscle training, and electroacupuncture are recommended as first-line treatment for women with SUI. Biofeedback and electric muscle stimulation can be adjunctive therapy for SUI. Antimuscarinics and \u03b2-3 agonists can be used as adjective therapy for those with OAB who do not improve with behavioral therapy. \u03b2-3 agonists have less anticholinergic side effects compared with antimuscarinics for OAB. Adverse medication effects can often lead to discontinuation due to poor tolerability. Third-line therapies are for those who fail conservative and pharmacologic therapies and lack high-grade evidence. Neuromodulation, neurotoxin injections, vaginal laser therapy, and acupuncture are third-line in OAB management. Pharmacologic management with \u03b1-1-blockers is recommended as first-line treatment for moderate to severe overflow incontinence from BPH. 5-\u03b1 reductase inhibitors can be used as an adjunct medication in those with refractory overflow incontinence symptoms and a PSA\u2009\u2265\u20091.5\u2009mg/dL.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving hospitalized patients with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) CA-ASB. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify predictors for subsequent symptomatic infections in patients with MDRP CA-ASB. The probability of remaining free from symptomatic infection was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 139 patients with MDRP CA-ASB. Subsequent symptomatic MDRP infections were observed in 37 (26.6%) patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that underlying urologic diseases (hazard ratio [HR]=2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.01-4.66, P=.047), active antibiotic treatment for MDRP (HR=2.34, 95% CI=1.02-5.38, P=.046), and recurrent bacteriuria (HR=3.57, 95% CI=1.73-7.38, P=.001) were independent predictors for subsequent symptomatic infections. The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly lower cumulative proportion of symptomatic infection-free patients among those receiving active antibiotic therapy for MDRP CA-ASB than among those who did not (41.7% vs 76.4%, P=.006, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the current guidelines against routine antibiotic therapy, even for MDRP CA-ASB, and emphasize the need for close monitoring and timely intervention in high-risk populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diagnostic stewardship of urine cultures from patients with indwelling urinary catheters may improve diagnostic specificity and clinical relevance of the test, but risk of patient harm is uncertain. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the impact of a computerized clinical decision support tool to promote institutional appropriateness criteria (neutropenia, kidney transplant, recent urologic surgery, or radiologic evidence of urinary tract obstruction) for urine cultures from patients with an indwelling urinary catheter. The primary outcome was a change in catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rate from baseline (34 mo) to intervention period (30 mo, including a 2-mo wash-in period). We analyzed patient-level outcomes and adverse events. RESULTS: Adjusted CAUTI rate decreased from 1.203 to 0.75 per 1,000 catheter-days (P = 0.52). Of 598 patients triggering decision support, 284 (47.5%) urine cultures were collected in agreement with institutional criteria and 314 (52.5%) were averted. Of 314 patients whose urine cultures were averted, 2 had a subsequent urine culture within 7 days that resulted in a change in antimicrobial therapy and 2 had diagnosis of bacteremia with suspected urinary source, but there were no delays in effective treatment. CONCLUSION: A diagnostic stewardship intervention was associated with an approximately 50% decrease in urine culture testing for inpatients with a urinary catheter. However, the overall CAUTI rate did not decrease significantly. Adverse outcomes were rare and minor among patients who had a urine culture averted. Diagnostic stewardship may be safe and effective as part of a multimodal program to reduce unnecessary urine cultures among patients with indwelling urinary catheters.",

Following emergency laparotomy and intensive care admission, the patient was catheterized to assist urine drainage and subsequent urine bacterial culture which yielded pan-drug-resistant P. rettgeri, signifying a notable instance of nosocomial infection by a multi-drug-resistant organism. Despite the organism's resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics, clinical improvement was observed with levofloxacin treatment, underlining the potential discrepancy between in vitro resistance patterns and in vivo response, particularly in urinary tract infections (UTIs) where urine drug concentrations are pivotal. This case underscores the necessity for heightened surveillance, stringent infection control measures, and judicious antibiotic use in managing infections caused by pan-drug-resistant pathogens like P. rettgeri, challenging the traditional paradigms of antimicrobial resistance and therapy in hospital settings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CA-UTIs) are a common hospital-acquired infection. We examined ciprofloxacin activity in a novel CA-UTI in vitro model. METHODS: Three ATCC strains [Escherichia coli (ECO)-25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN)-700721, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAE)-27853] and 45 clinical urinary isolates were assessed. Biofilm mass and planktonic bacterial density were quantified during drug-free incubation (72\u2005h) and following ciprofloxacin exposure (equivalent 750\u2005mg orally q12h, 3\u2005days). RESULTS: ECO produced smaller biofilms (6.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.1\u2005log10\u2005cfu/cm2) compared with KPN (7.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.7\u2005log10\u2005cfu/cm2) and PAE (7.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.2\u2005log10\u2005cfu/cm2), which extended along the entire catheter length. Following ciprofloxacin, all isolates with MIC\u200a>\u200a4\u2005mg/L had minimal biofilm disruption or planktonic kill. Ciprofloxacin resistance was most common in PAE isolates (10/16 isolates), compared with ECO (3/16 isolates) and KPN (6/16 isolates). Greater ciprofloxacin exposure (AUC0-24/MIC) was required for a 3\u2005log10 biofilm kill for KPN (5858; R2\u2005=\u20050.7774) compared with ECO (2117; R2\u2005=\u20050.7907) and PAE (2485; R2\u2005=\u20050.8260). Due to persistent growth in the bladder, ECO required greater ciprofloxacin exposure for a 3\u2005log10 planktonic kill (5920; R2\u2005=\u20050.8440) compared with KPN (2825; R2\u2005=\u20050.9121) and PAE (1760; R2\u2005=\u20050.8781). Monte Carlo simulation supported a 95% PTA for both a 3\u2005log10 biofilm and planktonic kill for ECO and KPN isolates with MIC\u200a\u2264\u200a0.5\u2005mg/L and PAE isolates with MIC\u200a\u2264\u200a1\u2005mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: In a novel CA-UTI model, following simulated ciprofloxacin therapy, KPN biofilms were comparatively more difficult to disrupt, ECO planktonic growth frequently persisted in the bladder, and PAE had greater propensity for emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) represent a significant burden in health care and its management is challenging. This study aims to assess and compare central European CAUTIs regarding diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis. METHODS: An anonymized online questionnaire was distributed among urologists in Austria, France, Germany, and Switzerland between January and October 2023, consisting of demographic questions on catheter management and diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis of CAUTIs. An analysis was performed per country. Comparisons were done with the Fisher's exact test (statistical significance with p <\u00a00.05). KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Out of 423 participating urologists, most regularly performed catheter changes and managed catheter-related issues, except for French urologists. Swiss urologists tended to change the catheter after a longer interval. In France, a higher estimated number of CAUTIs were observed. Diagnostic symptoms and measures varied significantly between countries. French urologists prescribed more antimicrobials per patient and administered longer treatment regimens. The choice of antimicrobial agents differed notably for nonfebrile and febrile CAUTIs, with cotrimoxazole/nitrofurantoin being common for nonfebrile cases and cephalosporin/amoxicillin for febrile ones. Follow-up protocols were similar among urologists, while prophylactic measures showed variations. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: CAUTI management varied notably across countries in terms of diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis. Discrepancies in antimicrobial therapy could be influenced by local resistance rates; yet, nonrecommended drugs and prolonged regimens, as compared with guideline recommendations, were common. This trend, along with inappropriate diagnostics and prophylaxis, may increase antimicrobial resistance and CAUTI morbidity. This study emphasizes the necessity for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship interventions, and proper training in CAUTI management. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this questionnaire-based study examining the clinical practices for managing urinary tract infections in patients with bladder catheters (CAUTIs), significant disparities were observed among European urologists regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis. These findings underscore the critical need for clear guidelines and comprehensive training in CAUTI management.",

      "abstract": "Bacteria develop biofilms for protection and persistent colonization. Biofilms of pathogenic bacteria can lead to serious medical problems. Bacterial biofilms on catheters used in the treatment of urinary tract diseases represent a major challenge for antibiotic therapy. Several attempts to eradicate biofilms using classical antibiotics and various alternatives, including antibiotic treatment of surfaces, surfaces that release silver ions, and surfaces with anti-adhesive properties, have not shown clinical efficacy in biofilm prevention or removal. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most problematic biofilm-forming uropathogens and accounts for approximately 10% of urinary tract infections. Novel glycomimetics that inhibit bacterial lectins have shown promising results in the prevention of P. aeruginosa biofilms and in interference with bacterial virulence. This mini-review summarizes the status of glycomimetic development and provides a perspective on their use in clinical practice. PATIENT SUMMARY: For patients with recurrent urinary tract infections and patients needing long-term catheter use to manage urinary problems, biofilms formed by bacteria can be a problem and are difficult to treat. New compounds that mimic carbohydrates, called glycomimetics, have shown promise in inhibiting these bacteria and the biofilms they form. More research on these compounds is needed before they can be used to treat patients.",

      "abstract": "Proteus mirabilis is a predominant cause of catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and a key virulence factor is its urease enzyme which can increase urine pH and form urinary stones, causing catheter blockage and facilitating bacteremia. The only FDA approved urease inhibitor, acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), has side effects that limit its clinical use, necessitating new approaches to target urease activity. We previously discovered that common urinary tract colonizers modulate P. mirabilis urease activity via secreted small molecules. In this study, we conduct a metabolomics analysis of six modulatory bacterial species to reveal urease-dampening metabolites. Of 31 candidate metabolites, seven reproducibly decrease P. mirabilis urease activity. All seven metabolites dampen urease activity in other urease-positive bacterial species, suggesting conserved targets. Six of the metabolites act via mixed inhibition of the urease enzyme. One metabolite, D-imidazole lactate, exhibits a non-competitive mechanism of urease inhibition along with antimicrobial activity and repression of the urease operon in P. mirabilis. Metabolite combinations with AHA demonstrate synergistic activity and prevent catheter encrustation in an in vitro model for CAUTI. Prophylactic use of urease dampening metabolites with AHA could improve the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment against catheter biofilms.",

      "abstract": "The increasing use of urinary catheters in healthcare, driven by an aging population and escalating antimicrobial resistance, presents both benefits and challenges. While they are essential to managing urinary retention and enabling precise urine output monitoring, their use significantly increases the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), the most common type of healthcare-associated infection. CAUTI risk is closely linked to the duration of catheterization and the formation of bacterial biofilms on catheter surfaces. These biofilms, often composed of polymicrobial communities encased in an extracellular matrix, promote persistent infections that are highly resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapies. Common CAUTI uropathogens include E. coli, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Candida spp. The complexity and resilience of these biofilm-associated infections underscore the urgent need for innovative treatment strategies. Therefore, dynamic in vitro bladder infection models, which replicate physiological conditions such as urine flow and bladder voiding, have become valuable tools for studying microbial behavior, biofilm development, and therapeutic interventions under real clinical conditions. This review provides an overview of CAUTIs, explores the role of biofilms in sub-optimal responses to antimicrobial treatment and advances in model systems, and presents promising new approaches to combating these infections.",

Awareness of PUBS is essential, as it can serve as an indicator of underlying infection. PATIENT CONCERNS: Two elderly male patients presented with striking purple discoloration of their urinary catheter bags. Caregivers expressed concern, although both patients denied fever, dysuria, or suprapubic pain. DIAGNOSES: PUBS secondary to UTI was diagnosed. Case 1 involved mixed bacterial growth, with risk factors including diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia, immobility, and prolonged catheterization. Case 2 had Candida tropicalis infection, with predisposing factors of stroke-related immobility, constipation, and chronic catheterization. INTERVENTIONS: Both patients underwent a Foley catheter and urine bag replacement. Case 1 received empirical oral ciprofloxacin, while case 2 required admission, intravenous antifungal therapy, and supportive hydration. OUTCOMES: Purple discoloration resolved after catheter replacement. Both patients achieved favorable outcomes without recurrence. LESSONS: While PUBS is typically benign, it reflects underlying UTIs and requires prompt intervention. Early recognition, catheter management, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are key to preventing complications. Clinician awareness is vital to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary anxiety.",

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.",

Bacterial colonisation may occur both during catheter insertion and prolonged catheterization by microorganisms in the urinary tract, consequently, increasing the bacteriuria risk due to biofilm formation. Nanogels, a class of soft nanocarriers, offer remarkable versatility for developing functional coatings on indwelling medical devices that can efficiently prevent biofilm formation. In this study, we designed an antibacterial and antibiofilm coating by leveraging the ultrasound-assisted assembly and nanogel self-organization on silicone catheters. The nanogel comprising biocompatible gum arabic and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) was used to encapsulate a synthetic broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide mimetic ceragenin (CSA-131). A coating from this bioactive nanogel was sonochemically built on the catheters without any prior surface modification. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that the coating provided antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity for up to 7 days of catheterization, next to catheter lubricity. Cytotoxicity assessment confirmed the absence of toxic effects, underscoring the biocompatibility of the coating formulation. These findings highlighted the potential of nanogels, combined with ultrasound technology, as an innovative approach for durable antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalization of urinary catheters, particularly susceptible to colonisation by microorganisms upon catheterization.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pan-drug resistance (PDR) is a ticking time bomb, as it causes high human hospitalizations and mortality rates. For instance, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with significant rates of urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to several reasons including antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and the presence of various virulence factors. Consequently, there is an urgent need for safe and effective alternative antibacterials. Phage therapy is a promising alternative that uses naturally occurring bacteriophages (phages). Therefore, our present study investigated the isolation and characterization of a novel virulent phage (vB_Ps_ZCPS13) against the PDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain (Ps13). METHODS: Phage vB_Ps_ZCPS13 was isolated from raw sewage water in Egypt during the springtime. The isolated phage was purified and amplified, followed by estimating its purity and genome size using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), morphology using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), antibacterial activity against other P. aeruginosa hosts, physiochemical stability studies, whole genome sequencing, antibiofilm activity on urinary catheters using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cytotoxicity assays against normal human skin fibroblast (HSF) cell lines. RESULTS: Based on vB_Ps_ZCPS13 morphology under TEM, the phage has been classified as a myovirus. In consistent with the PFGE results, DNA sequencing revealed a phage genome size of 92,443\u00a0bp, with lytic-associated genes and no antimicrobial resistance or virulence factors. Phage vB_Ps_ZCPS13 presented a wide host range of over 93% of tested clinical isolates having different multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indices. Furthermore, phage vB_Ps_ZCPS13 exhibited high efficiency in plaque formation (EOP\u2009\u2265\u20091) against 13% of the strains and exhibited low frequencies of bacteriophage insensitive mutants (BIM). The physical stability test against harsh environmental conditions revealed phage stability within a pH range of 3.0-11.0 and stable at temperatures below 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Phage vB_Ps_ZCPS13 also exposed a significant antibacterial activity in vitro across different MOIs, with the highest reduction in bacterial growth observed at lower MOIs. Furthermore, vB_Ps_ZCPS13 demonstrated potent biofilm inhibition and clearance capabilities, effectively eradicating P. aeruginosa from the urinary catheter surface. Moreover, the phage presented no cytotoxicity against normal human skin fibroblast (HSF) cell lines at high titer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers an effective phage as a therapeutic candidate against PDR Gram-negative P. aeruginosa infections, including catheter-associated urinary tract infections.",

      "abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infection is one of the most common healthcare-associated infections, with biofilm formation playing a key role in its pathogenesis. Indwelling medical devices introduce ideal pathways inside the body for pathogens and feature surfaces conducive to biofilm development, often leading to severe clinical infections recalcitrant to antimicrobials. When bacteria and fungi switch to biofilm mode of growth, they produce a matrix in the form of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). This creates a unique environment for growing virulent colonisers and persisting cells while forming a shielding barrier against immune system attacks, antimicrobial agents and mechanical removal by fluid shear forces. To address this challenge, LubriShieldTM - a novel permanent coating - was invented and evenly applied to both internal and external surfaces of indwelling urinary Foley catheters. Without releasing active substances, it effectively prevented pathogens from producing biofilm. The superhydrophilic coating, incorporating a proprietary anti-fouling ligand, significantly inhibited colonising uropathogens from forming biofilm for up to 14 days in artificial urine medium without microbial killing (up to 99% reduction, P\u2009<\u20090.001). In a glass bladder flow model, LubriShieldTM still significantly reduced biofilm formation by 83% (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Importantly, LubriShield\u2122 maintained its antibiofilm efficacy even after conditioning with fibrinogen, a host-derived protein known to promote bacterial attachment (P\u2009=\u20090.007). RNA-seq analysis revealed significant downregulation of genes associated with microbial EPS formation on the coated surfaces. Additionally, microorganisms adhering to LubriShieldTM coated catheters showed a 78% increased susceptibility to antibiotics compared to those on uncoated catheters (P\u2009=\u20090.004).",

      "abstract": "Urinary catheters are used extensively in hospitals and long-term care and they are highly prone to infection. Understanding the pathways by which bacteria colonise a urinary catheter could guide strategies to mitigate infection, but quantitative models for this colonisation process are lacking. Here we present a mathematical model for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter that integrates population dynamics and fluid dynamics. The model describes bacteria migrating up the outside surface of the catheter, spreading into the bladder and being swept through the catheter lumen. Computer simulations of the model reveal that clinical outcomes for long-term versus short-term catheterisation are controlled by different factors: the rate of urine production by the kidneys as opposed to urethral length, catheter surface properties and bacterial motility. Our work may help explain variable susceptibility to catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) among individuals and the mixed success of antimicrobial surface coatings. Our model suggests that for long-term catheterised patients, increasing fluid intake or reducing residual urine volume in the bladder may help prevent infection, while antimicrobial surface coatings are predicted to be effective only for short-term catheterised patients. Therefore, different catheter management strategies could be rationally targeted to long-term vs short-term catheterised patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections related to catheters are one of the most common urinary infections and can affect patient outcomes. Hence, coating urinary catheters is an important issue against several resistant bacterial pathogens that can form a resistant biofilm. This study examined the antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of the coated catheter with green silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) made from Origanum majorana. METHODS: Aloe Vera, Ocimum basilicum, Matricaria chamomilla, Foeniculum vulgare, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Origanum majorana, Urtica urens, Salvia Rosmarinus, and Salvia officinalis hydro-alcoholic extracts were prepared and tested for their antibacterial activities utilizing the agar well diffusion technique. Furthermore, O. majorana extract was tested against biofilm formation using a microtiter plate assay. UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF was used for the profiling and tentative identification of biological compounds in the O. majorana extract. O. majorana was used to prepare AgNPs-MARJ, which were characterized for their size, charge, and shape. Further, AgNPs-MARJ were used to coat two types of urinary catheters. The coated catheters were tested for their resistance to bacterial biofilm formation and compared with non-coated catheters. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Initial antimicrobial screening tests showed that O. majorana extracts presented a significant (p<0.05; ANOVA/Tukey) antibacterial activity against the studied species of bacteria compared to the other plant extracts. O. majorana extract showed MIC value of 35.0 mg/mL for E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae and displayed the highest antibiofilm activity at 100 mg/mL. LC-MS analysis tentatively identified the presence of quinic acid and flavonoid-based constituents like apigenin which contribute to the antibiofilm activity. AgNPs-MARJ were efficiently prepared with a size and charge of 111.5 nm and -19.66 mV, respectively. The coated urinary catheters showed a significant (p<0.05) decrease in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation compared to control non-coated catheters. CONCLUSION: AgNPs-MARJ offer promising prospects for addressing biofilm-related challenges in urinary tract-related catheter infections.",

      "abstract": "Purple urine bag syndrome is an uncommon condition that occurs in patients with long-standing indwelling urinary catheters, due to urinary tract infection (UTI) by bacteria producing sulfatase or phosphatase enzymes. This results in the formation of the pigments indigo (blue) and indirubin (red), together providing a purple appearance to urine. Management includes a change of catheter and appropriate antibiotics. Although prognosis is usually favourable, rare incidences of complications like Fournier's gangrene have been reported.We report three patients who developed purple urine bag syndrome: a man in his late 50s, a woman in her early 30s and a woman in her early 70s, who were on home-based care with regular home visits by the specialist palliative care team. None of them had any other signs or symptoms suggestive of UTIs. Their urinary catheters and collection bags were changed and proper catheter care was reinforced. All three patients were given antibiotics based on urine culture and sensitivity results. Following the same, urine colour reverted to normal in all patients and none of them had any recurrence.We would like to underline the importance of identifying purple urine bag syndrome as an indicator of underlying UTI, especially in palliative care settings, where patients may not manifest the classical signs and symptoms of UTI. We also would like to highlight the importance of patient and caregiver education on proper catheter care for prevention.",

The widespread use of antibiotic treatments contributes to the global health problem of antimicrobial resistance development. To slow down the progression of antimicrobial resistance, it is essential that we explore nonantibiotic preventive treatments for this common condition. We aim to report discussions regarding nonantibiotic preventive strategies for recurrent urinary tract infections in both catheterized and non-catheterized patients that took place at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society meeting in Bristol in 2024. METHODS: We undertook a think-tank session during this multidisciplinary meeting specifically designated for discussion regarding both established and emerging nonantibiotic treatments for UTI prevention in both catheterized and non-catheterized patients. This led to the generation of pertinent research questions, which hope to shape future UTI research. RESULTS: We describe the discussions that took place and document the important research questions that were proposed during the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society meeting in Bristol in 2024. CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of established UTI preventative strategies for UTI prevention in both catheterized and non-catheterized patients. Emerging UTI prevention treatments have varying levels of evidence to support their use, and in many areas, further research is needed to establish their place in clinical pathways.",

      "abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) are a global health burden. Moreover, the friction during urinary catheter placement also induces pain in patients. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop effective antibacterial and lubricative coatings on the surface of urinary catheter. In this work, a facile volatilization film-forming method is used to construct coatings on catheter surfaces. Xanthan gum (SR), which has good lubricative and antifouling properties, is oxidized to cross-link with multi-amino compounds, gentamicin (GS), and gelatin, to fabricate uniform coatings on silicone catheters (SR-GXGs). The structures of SR-GXGs are regulated by the components of the film formation solutions. The bacterial metabolism can produce an acidic micro-environment that can regulate GS release to achieve on-demand administration. SR-GXG2 can eliminate 99.99% of common pathogenic bacteria and reduce the dynamic friction coefficient by 98.73%, and showed high stability in a 7-day flowing experiment. In addition, the universality of this method is demonstrated on various kinds of matrices with different shapes, including commercial urethral catheters. In vivo, SR-GXG2\u00a0can effectively avoid urinary tract injury and encrustation phenomenon because of its good anti-infection, antifouling, and lubricative properties.

      "abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are some of the most common hospital-acquired infections. Proteus mirabilis, a common pathogen associated with urinary tract infections, has swarming motility and has pili on its surface for adhesion and flagella for upward movement. Migration of P. mirabilis along the catheter surface can lead to ascending urinary tract infection. However, there is currently a lack of effective strategies to inhibit or delay the colonization, migration, and encrustation formation of P. mirabilis in urinary catheters. This study developed a method for constructing a stable superhydrophobic coating on the surface of urinary catheters using a layer-by-layer approach. The adhesion and deposition of polydopamine were enhanced by pre-coating a liquid bandage film on the polydimethylsiloxane surface, resulting in a multilayer micro-nano composite structure on the catheter surface. This structure was combined with copper ions and superhydrophobic modifiers, ultimately resulting in a highly stable superhydrophobic coating. The coating retains its superhydrophobic properties after prolonged incubation, friction tests, and tape peeling tests. Importantly, the coating demonstrates excellent efficacy in inhibiting P. mirabilis colonization, migration, and encrustation formation. This study offers novel insights into developing biomedical superhydrophobic coatings with enhanced stability and efficacy in inhibiting urinary tract bacterial infections.",
