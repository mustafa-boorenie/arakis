      "abstract": "The interaction of instructional videos plays a critical role in shaping learners' cognitive and emotional engagement. This study examined the effects of four types of instructional video interactions grounded in the ICAP framework (Passive, Active, Constructive, Interactive), implemented through one non-interactive and three interactive formats: one-way, two-way, and multi-way. Ninety-two participants were randomly assigned to the four conditions. Results indicate that instructional videos interaction enhance learners' motivation, engagement, enjoyment, and learning outcomes, while reducing cognitive load. Specifically, one-way interaction stimulated motivation; two-way interaction further improved motivation, reduced cognitive load, and enhanced retention; multi-way interaction showed the most comprehensive benefits across all measures. Additionally, learners' motivation was found to mediate the relationship between interaction and deeper cognitive engagement, ultimately contributing to improved learning retention. These findings suggest that increasing meaningful interaction-through diverse strategies such as pedagogical agents and affective feedback-can promote active participation and deeper learning in video-based instruction.",

      "abstract": "Self-regulated learning (SRL) is critical for learning across tasks, domains, and contexts. Despite its importance, research shows that not all learners are equally skilled at accurately and dynamically monitoring and regulating their self-regulatory processes. Therefore, learning technologies, such as intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), have been designed to measure and foster SRL. This paper presents an overview of over 10 years of research on SRL with MetaTutor, a hypermedia-based ITS designed to scaffold college students' SRL while they learn about the human circulatory system. MetaTutor's architecture and instructional features are designed based on models of SRL, empirical evidence on human and computerized tutoring principles of multimedia learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational systems for metacognition and SRL, and research on SRL from our team and that of other researchers. We present MetaTutor followed by a synthesis of key research findings on the effectiveness of various versions of the system (e.g., adaptive scaffolding vs. no scaffolding of self-regulatory behavior) on learning outcomes. First, we focus on findings from self-reports, learning outcomes, and multimodal data (e.g., log files, eye tracking, facial expressions of emotion, screen recordings) and their contributions to our understanding of SRL with an ITS. Second, we elaborate on the role of embedded pedagogical agents (PAs) as external regulators designed to scaffold learners' cognitive and metacognitive SRL strategy use. Third, we highlight and elaborate on the contributions of multimodal data in measuring and understanding the role of cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational (CAMM) processes. Additionally, we unpack some of the challenges these data pose for designing real-time instructional interventions that scaffold SRL. Fourth, we present existing theoretical, methodological, and analytical challenges and briefly discuss lessons learned and open challenges.",

BACKGROUND: The role of CAs in education (i.e., pedagogical agents) has been long studied, but their potential for supporting self-care has received less attention, especially for older adults. METHODS: We reviewed work on pedagogical agents and considered how it informs the design of CAs for older adults. We propose a framework for designing CAs to support older adult self-care, which organizes a review of work in this area and integration with the pedagogical agent literature. RESULTS: Our review of the pedagogical agent literature revealed an evolution from teaching machines to interactive, social systems that influence student motivational as well as learning outcomes. To integrate this review with work on CAs and self-care, we developed a framework that specifies how self-care goals evolve with stages of an illness, communication goals that support self-care at each stage, patient needs, and requirements for CAs to support these needs. The review identified an agenda for future research on CA functions and features that help older adults accept need for self-care, establish self-care, and sustain self-care over time. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating insights from the pedagogical agent literature with research on developing CAs for self-care defines an agenda for developing and evaluating CAs to help older adults manage illness.",

      "abstract": "Traditional teaching evaluation methods are often retrospective and coarse-grained, lacking the continuous, moment-to-moment feedback required for real-time pedagogical adaptation in language training. Existing intelligent tutoring systems frequently fail to address this, underutilizing multimodal behavioral signals and leaving a critical gap in understanding whether such signals are essential for learning effective policies. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to solve this problem. We propose a hybrid cognitive-linguistic model using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) actor-critic agent, which operates on a novel 516-dimensional state vector that fuses a 512-dimensional semantic embedding from a pre-trained T5 model with a 4-dimensional vector of simulated cognitive-behavioral signals (correctness, response time, attention, hint request). Tested in a simulated learner environment built on the Tatoeba corpus, our agent autonomously discovers a highly effective policy, achieving a mean episodic reward of 6.563, on par with the optimal heuristic baseline. The identified policy, albeit optimal in the simulation, embodies a counterintuitive method that significantly prioritized task repetition by the learner. Our hypothesis is confirmed by a critical ablation experiment: an agent that is deprived of the cognitive-behavioral signals does not learn, and they are as good as a random baseline (mean reward 5.213). The present work gives conclusive evidence that multimodal cognitive-behavioral cues are not only supplementary but are an inevitable part of learning by adaptive pedagogical agents. We mainly provide validation of a hybrid state representation that allows an RL agent to learn effective teaching strategies, making way for more useful and customized educational technologies.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive learning systems increasingly employ pedagogical agents (PAs) to enhance students' engagement and learning outcomes, yet little is known about how motivational PAs influence students' conceptual understanding and strategic choice-making. This study compared 49 school students (at 9th and 10th grade) using an adaptive algebra learning environment with either motivational PAs or instructional prompts (non-PAs). Results revealed that while all students demonstrated learning gains, prior knowledge significantly moderated outcomes. Lower-knowledge students achieved the greatest gains through reflective engagement with foundational tasks, whereas higher-knowledge students often adopted intuitive but error-prone strategies. Notably, process mining and lag sequential analysis revealed distinct choice-making trajectories, uncovering how motivational PAs influenced self-regulation patterns over time. This study advances the field by operationalizing choice-making as a measurable self-regulated learning construct and reframing strategic disengagement as an adaptive, agentic behavior. Findings underscore the importance of designing adaptive systems that support both content mastery and strategic choice-making.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nursing is demanding, requiring advanced clinical decision-making and emergency management skills. Simulation-based instruction is central to ICU nursing education but remains constrained by the cost and time required for scenario authoring, limited faculty capacity for feedback, and slow content updates. Large language models (LLMs)-based pedagogical agents may augment instructor training by supporting rapid scenario generation, formative guidance, and on-demand assistance. However, evidence from real-world ICU instructor training is limited, and the balance between perceived benefits, usability, and objective educational outcomes is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and learner-perceived impact of integrating an LLM-based pedagogical agent into ICU simulation instructor training. METHODS: An exploratory quasi-experimental study was conducted with 40 ICU nurses from a tertiary hospital in February 2025. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n\u00a0=\u00a020) using the LLM-based AI teaching agent for simulation training, and a comparison group (n\u00a0=\u00a020) using traditional blended learning. The training effectiveness was assessed using the Chinese version of the Jeffries Simulation Design Scale (SDS), the System Usability Scale (SUS), the Adult Online Learning Self-Efficacy Scale, and a teaching satisfaction questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and t-tests. RESULTS: The experimental group outperformed the comparison group in multiple areas. Specifically, in the SDS, the experimental group scored higher in case authenticity (5.00 vs. 4.00, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), scenario complexity (5.00 vs. 4.00, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), feedback mechanisms (5.00 vs. 4.00, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), interactivity (5.00 vs. 4.00, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and teaching objectives (5.00 vs. 4.25, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The experimental group also showed higher self-efficacy in learning ability (16.0 vs. 13.0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and learning technology (18.0 vs. 16.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.045). Satisfaction was high in both groups and demonstrated a pronounced ceiling effect. CONCLUSION: Embedding an LLM-based pedagogical agent into ICU simulation instructor training was feasible and associated with more favorable learner-perceived simulation design quality and online learning self-efficacy, while usability did not differ from traditional blended learning. Findings are preliminary and hypothesis-generating; future multi-centre, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine efficacy and isolate the LLM component's independent contribution.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: To address the challenge of face-to-face communication in online learning, integrating pedagogical agents and emotional feedback has been proposed as viable solutions. However, research on their impact during formative assessments remains limited. METHODS: This study therefore conducted a 2 (Pedagogical agent: present vs. absent) \u00d7 2 (Emotional feedback: present vs. absent) experimental study using an online learning system to explore their effects on learning performance. RESULTS: Results indicated that pedagogical agents had a slightly negative influence on transfer scores, while emotional feedback significantly boosted engagement. When both were combined, learners exhibited the highest motivation, although this did not significantly enhance emotional perception or performance and slightly reduced transfer scores. Notably, the use of these tools shortened learning duration. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that educators should exercise caution when designing pedagogical agents in online formative assessment environments to avoid potential distractions during the learning process. Meanwhile, the integration of emotional feedback may contribute to creating a more humanized digital learning atmosphere, thereby supporting learners in their online learning experience. Overall, this study provides crucial insights into the complex effects of these tools on learning in computer-based online formative assessments, guiding future design and application.",

Cognitive load is an important factor in measuring the effectiveness of multimedia learning, but the results of pedagogical agents' effects on learners' cognitive load have been consistently inconsistent. In this study, a meta-analytical approach was used to comprehensively analyse 24 empirical studies to investigate the effects of pedagogical agents on students' cognitive load in multimedia learning and the moderating factors in their process. The results showed that the teaching agent only slightly reduced the cognitive load. Moderating analyses show that the pedagogical agent appearance, pedagogical agent role, subject domain, form of media mix, intervention duration, and learning pace play a moderating role in the process of the pedagogical agent's influence on cognitive load, and can significantly reduce the cognitive load of learners.",

AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of warm colours and anthropomorphism as emotional design elements on multimedia learning, and whether combining a positive pedagogical agent with positive learning materials would be better. SAMPLES: Experiment 1 recruited 203 elementary school students. Experiment 2 recruited 140 elementary school students. METHODS: Experiment 1 employed a 2 (Colours: warm vs. grayscale)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Anthropomorphism: with vs. without) between-subjects design. Experiment 2 employed a 2 (Learning materials: positive vs. neutral)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Pedagogical agent: positive vs. neutral) between-subjects design. RESULTS: Results of Experiment 1 showed that warm colours reduced boredom and anxiety; anthropomorphism increased enjoyment, intrinsic motivation, and mental effort, and reduced boredom; their combination facilitated retention and transfer performance. Results of Experiment 2 revealed that combining a positive pedagogical agent with positive learning materials ameliorated learners' overall emotional experiences, but did not significantly affect retention and transfer performance. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating both warm colours and anthropomorphism as emotional design elements yielded the most favourable impact in designing positive learning materials. Integrating emotional design approaches to both learning materials and pedagogical agents could be conducive to happy and effective learning, showing the importance of holistic approaches to emotional design in educational settings.",

      "abstract": "There is still a debate on the influence and effectiveness of pedagogical agents in a learning environment, especially on the means these agents employ for enhancing students' academic performance. The current study aims at measuring the effectiveness of cognitive and affective feedback (CaAF) types that a human teacher and a virtual Affective Pedagogical Tutor (APT) used in their groups of students (control and experimental groups respectively) in an authentic long-term learning situation. Participants were a sample of 115 students carrying out collaborative activities in a \"web design\" course. Our findings showed that APT cognitive feedback (CF) significantly increased students' learning outcomes compared to the human teacher's feedback, whereas APT affective feedback (AF) only achieved partial success. Nevertheless, the study has some limitations: it is based on a single course and a specific academic context, limiting the generalizability of its findings. Additionally, while cognitive feedback demonstrated a clear impact, the analysis of affective feedback was less conclusive, and its design requires further refinement. Finally, the cross-sectional design of the study restricts the ability to assess whether improvements in learning outcomes persist over time. Future research directions include exploring the generalizability of results across diverse disciplines, deepening the analysis of affective feedback, and incorporating longitudinal studies to evaluate the durability of the observed effects.",

However, many existent tools are able to perform tasks that human professionals (educators, tutors, professors) could perform, just in a timelier manner. While discussing the possible implementation of AI-based tools in our university's educational programs, we reviewed the current literature and identified a number of capabilities that future AI solutions may feature, in order to improve higher education processes, with a focus on distance higher education. Specifically, we suggest that innovative tools could influence the methodologies by which students approach learning; facilitate connections and information attainment beyond course materials; support the communication with the professor; and, draw from motivation theories to foster learning engagement, in a personalized manner.

The inclusion of pedagogical agents raises several design questions, for example on what kind of clothing the agent should wear.

In an online experiment (N = 200), we investigated whether creating thematically appropriate clothing and setting has some added value in that it improves learning outcomes in comparison to more neutral assets. Whereas all participants acquired knowledge from the animated video, there were no main effects of clothing and setting for any of the dependent variables, but an interaction for learning outcomes (\u03b7p2=0.02), indicating that the appropriately dressed agent worked better combined with the inappropriate setting than with the appropriate setting. Overall, given those non-significant main effects and the small effect size of the interaction, there seem to be some degrees of freedom for designers of pedagogical agents in animated learning videos. However, these degrees of freedom may be limited to at least moderate (i.e., neutral) levels of appropriateness.",

However, previous meta-analyses have rarely focused on the specific types of regulated learning scaffolding. Therefore, this meta-analysis examines the effects of different types of regulated learning scaffolding on regulation strategies and academic performance. A total of 46 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The findings showed that overall, regulated learning scaffolding had a moderate effect (g\u2009=\u20090.587). In addition, moderation analyses were performed using a random effects model that focused on four types of scaffolding. The results showed that overall, composite tools had the greatest effect, while the most useful scaffolding for SRL and SSRL were group awareness tools (g\u2009=\u20090.61) and composite tools (g\u2009=\u20090.53), respectively. In terms of learning outcomes, composite tools had the greatest effect on regulation strategies, while intelligent pedagogical agents had the greatest effect on academic performance. We also performed a meta-regression analysis to identify the moderators that had the greatest influence on the effects of regulated learning scaffolding. The results showed that grade level, academic subject, and cooperation all had a significant impact. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence for validating the effectiveness of four regulated learning scaffolding and for discovering their function for SSRL, and presented some practical implications of our findings.",

In three experiments, undergraduates were asked to view a narrated animation about synaptic transmission that included either a happy PA (smiling expression and enthusiastic voice) or a neutral PA (neutral expression and calm voice) and subsequently took emotions, motivation, cognitive outcomes tests. Across three experiments, the happy PA group reported more positive emotions (ds = 0.70, 0.46, and 0.60) and higher level of motivation (ds = 0.76, 0.49, and 0.51) than the neutral PA group. Moreover, the happy PA prompted higher germane load (d = 0.41) than a neutral PA in Experiment 3. However, adding a happy PA to the screen did not improve learning performance. In addition, in Experiment 2, learners' usage of emotion regulation strategies moderated the effectiveness of affective PA on positive emotions in learners. Specifically, happy PAs increased the positive emotions of students who used expressive suppression strategy (d = 0.99) but not those who used cognitive reappraisal strategy (d = 0.13). In Experiment 3, the effectiveness of affective PAs was not moderated by learners' prior knowledge. Results support the cognitive affective theory of learning with media (CATLM) that students are happier and more motivated when they learn from happy PAs than from neutral PAs.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we propose FT3, an adaptive intelligent tutoring system based on Brain Computer Interface(BCI). It can automatically generate different difficulty levels of lecturing video with teachers from textbook adapting to student engagement measured by BCI. Most current studies employ animated images to create pedagogical agents in such adaptive learning environments. However, evidence suggests that human teacher video brings a better learning experience than animated images. We design a virtual teacher generation engine consisting of text-to-speech (TTS) and lip synthesis method, being able to generate high-quality adaptive lecturing clips of talking teachers with accurate lip sync merely based on a textbook and teacher's photo. We propose a BCI to measure engagement, serving as an indicator for adaptively generating appropriate lecturing videos. We conduct a preliminary study to build and evaluate FT3. Results verify that FT3 can generate synced lecturing videos, and provide proper levels of learning content with an accuracy of 73.33%.",

The present study seeks to compare the effects of viewing pictures vs. imitating iconic gestures on learning second language (L2) vocabulary. In our study participants learned L2 words (nouns, verbs, and adjectives) together with a virtual, pedagogical agent. The to-be-learned items were either (i) enriched with pictures, or (ii) with gestures that had to be imitated, or (iii) without any non-verbal enrichment as control. Results showed that gesture imitation was particularly supportive for learning nouns, whereas pictures showed to be most beneficial for memorizing verbs. These findings, suggesting that the type of vocabulary learning strategy has to match with the type of linguistic material to be learned, have important educational implications for L2 classrooms and technology-enhanced tutoring systems.",

To help address this question, students were asked to twice view a 4-min narrated presentation on how solar cells work in which the screen showed an animated pedagogical agent standing to the left of 11 successive slides. Across three experiments, learners performed better on a transfer test when a human-voiced agent displayed human-like gestures, facial expression, eye gaze, and body movement than when the agent did not, yielding an embodiment effect. In Experiment 2 the embodiment effect was found when the agent spoke in a human voice but not in a machine voice. In Experiment 3, the embodiment effect was found both when students were told the onscreen agent was consistent with their choice of agent characteristics and when inconsistent. Students who viewed a highly embodied agent also rated the social attributes of the agent more positively than did students who viewed a nongesturing agent. The results are explained by social agency theory, in which social cues in a multimedia message prime a feeling of social partnership in the learner, which leads to deeper cognitive processing during learning, and results in a more meaningful learning outcome as reflected in transfer test performance.",

According to social agency theory, the presentation of social cues (the image and voice of the agent) may prime the social interaction schema and cause the learner to deeply process the learning material. Research on pedagogical agents focuses mainly on either the role of the presence of pedagogical agents, by comparing agent and no-agent groups, or on the design of the character, by comparing different agent groups. This article takes a comprehensive view combining both approaches in order to answer the question of how pedagogical agents should be designed so as to promote learner motivation and learning. It is argued that not only the mere presence, but also the valence of the social cues presented plays a decisive role. Two experiments examine the role of the perceived appeal of a pedagogical agent\u2019s appearance and voice. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that pedagogical agents may promote transfer performance, but only if they are appealing in appearance. The mere inclusion of a pedagogical agent yielded no effect on motivation or learning. Experiment 2 suggests that a high appeal of the pedagogical agent\u2019s appearance and voice promoted transfer performance. However, this advantage did not occur when compared to a control group without an agent. The presentation of two unappealing social cues (appearance and voice) even harmed transfer. This result suggests an important modification of social agency theory.",

In 3 experiments, college students learned about synaptic transmission from a multimedia narrated presentation while their eye movements were tracked and subsequently took learning outcome tests. In Experiments 1 and 2, students who had a gesturing PA added to the screen performed significantly better on learning outcome tests of transfer (ds = 0.77 and 0.80) and retention (ds = 1.16 and 1.00) and spent more time attending to target material based on eye-tracking measures including fixation time (ds = 1.53 and 2.27) and number of fixations (ds = 1.54 and 1.70). In Experiments 2 and 3, students who learned with a gesturing PA outperformed those who learned with a static PA on transfer (ds = 0.72 and 1.02), retention (ds = 0.96 and 0.93), fixation time (ds = 2.07 and 1.82), and number of fixations (ds = 1.64 and 2.99). In Experiment 2, adding a static PA to the screen did not improve performance. In Experiment 3, adding signaling such as color coding did not improve performance for students who received a gesturing PA. Results support the embodiment principle that people learn better from onscreen multimedia lessons when a gesturing PA is added to the screen, and social agency theory, which posits that social cues can prime learners to process the material more actively and develop better learning outcomes.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background With the rapid popularization of e\u2010learning, how to improve online learning has aroused widespread concern. A human\u2010like pedagogical agent (PA) that displays eye gaze and gestures, is often added to online multimedia lessons to increase social connection and improve learning in e\u2010learning environments. However, there has been a debate about how PAs affect learning processes and learning outcomes. Objectives Social agency theory holds that learners can build a social connection with PAs, which affects learning processes and outcomes. This study seeks to reveal how PAs influence learning by exploring the influence of PAs on learning outcomes and brain activity during learning. Methods College students viewed a multimedia lesson on the process of chemical synaptic transmission either with or without an embodied PA on the left side of the screen that pointed to the graphic as she lectured. During learning students' brain cortical activity was measured by a functional near\u2010infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system, and after learning students completed learning outcomes post\u2010tests. Results and Conclusions Consistent with social agency theory, students learning with a PA performed better on learning outcome tests and showed greater brain activity in the social areas of the brain during learning based on fNIRS measures. Implications By using fNIRS technology, this study provides preliminary new support for the idea that learners engage in social processing during online learning with an embodied PA that leads to improved learning outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In a traditional classroom environment, instructor enthusiasm has been shown to enhance student\u2019s emotion, affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and cognitive outcome. Additionally, emotional response theory argues that enthusiastic verbal and nonverbal cues of an instructor will induce positive emotional states in learners, which in turn, enact learners\u2019 approach behaviours in the learning process. Therefore, should a pedagogical agent convey enthusiastic behaviours in a multimedia learning environment? Literature and theoretical reviews offer two competing views. The first view, based on emotional response theory, predicts that enthusiastic verbal and nonverbal cues of a pedagogical agent can induce higher positive emotions in learners, which in turn, enhance affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and cognitive outcome. However, the second view, based on cognitive load theory, suggests that pedagogical agent enthusiasm may increase extraneous cognitive load (additional processing in the mind), which negatively impact emotion, affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and cognitive outcome. To investigate the effects of agent enthusiasm, seventy-two university freshmen interacted with either an enthusiastic agent or a neutral agent (operationalized through vocal tones, facial expression, gestures, and remarks) that simulates the instructional role of a virtual tutor that delivers narrative demonstrations on how to predict the outputs of C-Programming algorithms. The results of our study showed that pedagogical agent enthusiasm significantly enhanced emotion, intrinsic motivation, affective perceptions, and cognitive outcome. Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that the facilitating effects of agent enthusiasm on intrinsic motivation, affective perceptions of the learning environment, and affective perceptions of the pedagogical agent were fully mediated by a learner\u2019s positive emotion, thus demonstrating that the framework of emotional response theory can be applied to learner-agent interaction in a multimedia learning environment. Implications and suggestions for future research related to pedagogical agent enthusiasm are discussed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy is a global strategic objective in education. However, little is known about how AI should be taught. In this paper, 46 studies in academic conferences and journals are reviewed to investigate pedagogical strategies, learning tools, assessment methods in AI literacy education in K-12 contexts, and students\u2019 learning outcomes. The investigation reveals that the promotion of AI literacy education has seen significant progress in the past two decades. This highlights that intelligent agents, including Google\u2019s Teachable Machine, Learning ML, and Machine Learning for Kids, are age-appropriate tools for AI literacy education in K-12 contexts. Kindergarten students can benefit from learning tools such as PopBots, while software devices, such as Scratch and Python, which help to develop the computational thinking of AI algorithms, can be introduced to both primary and secondary schools. The research shows that project-based, human\u2013computer collaborative learning and play- and game-based approaches, with constructivist methodologies, have been applied frequently in AI literacy education. Cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning outcomes, course satisfaction and soft skills acquisition have been reported. The paper informs educators of appropriate learning tools, pedagogical strategies, assessment methodologies in AI literacy education, and students\u2019 learning outcomes.

      "abstract": "Research on animated pedagogical agents (agents) is viewed as a very positive attempt to introduce more pedagogical support and motivational elements into multi-media instruction. Yet, existing empirical studies that examine the learning benefits of agents have had very mixed results, largely due to the way that they are designed. This article will suggest five design principles for future research on the impact of agents on learning and motivation including: 1) The Balanced Separation Principle describes need for adequate controls that tease out the specific type of learning and/or motivational support the agent is providing; 2) The Variety of Outcomes Principle suggests different measures to test a variety of learning and motivation outcomes that may be influenced by agents; 3) The Robust Measurement Principle advises researchers to pay special attention to the reliability and construct validity of experimenter designed measures; 4) The Cost-Effectiveness Principle recommends the collection of data on the relative cost of producing agent and non-agent treatments; and 5) The Cognitive Load Principle alerts those who plan treatments for experiments to exercise caution when developing and testing agents that are visually and aurally \u201cnoisy\u201d or complex.",

The review investigates different affective measures within 99 pedagogical agent outcome measures. The results suggest that learners may prefer pedagogical agents compared to non-agent control conditions, and pedagogical agents may provide motivational benefits for some populations under certain conditions. However, it is unclear whether pedagogical agents impose extraneous cognitive load. Overall, consistent with research around learning outcomes (Mayer, Dow, & Mayer, 2003), the results suggest that the image of the agent may not be necessary for the learner to receive the affective benefits of the interaction. We delineate limitations of the current study and future research directions.",

Even though the extant literature suggests that pedagogical CAs can improve learning outcomes, there exists little empirical evidence of what design features drive this effect. This study reports on an exploratory field experiment involving 31 pupils in commercial high schools and finds that students achieved better learning outcomes when preparing for their tests with a pedagogical CA than without. However, the drivers of this effect remain unclear. Neither the use frequency of the design features nor the pupils\u2019 expectations towards the CA could explain the improvement in marks. However, for the subjective perception of learning achievement, pupils\u2019 expectations was a significant predictor. These findings provide support for the use of pedagogical CAs in teaching but also highlight that the drivers of better learning outcomes still remain unknown.",

Additionally, higher education needs effective pedagogies to achieve intended learning outcomes. This emphasizes the need to redesign active learning experiences in the GenAI era. Authentic assessment and experiential learning are two possible meaningful alternatives in this context. Accordingly, this article investigates how GenAI can enhance teaching and learning by constructively addressing study situations beyond conventional learning approaches and cultivating high-order skills and knowledge acquisition. This study employs thing ethnography to examine GenAI tools\u2019 integration with authentic assessment and experiential learning and explore implementation alternatives. The results reveal insights into creating human-centered and GenAI-enhanced learning experiences within a constructive alignment. Specific examples are also provided to guide their implementation. Our contributions extend beyond the traditional use of GenAI tools as mere agents-to-write or agents-to-answer questions to become agents-to-support experiential learning for authentic assessment. These findings underscore the transformative role of GenAI tools in enhancing teaching and learning efficacy and effectiveness. The limitations in treating GenAI tools as subjects in thing ethnography are acknowledged, with potential for future implementation evaluation.",

Based on cognitive load theory, it was expected that the experimental condition with the pedagogical agent would facilitate students to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information, and therefore lead to higher learning outcomes and lower cognitive load than the control condition without a pedagogical agent. Based on 133 seventh-grade students as participants, the results confirmed the hypotheses, indicating that the pedagogical agent had a more positive effect on learning outcomes and resulted in a more favorable relationship between learning outcomes and cognitive load.

      "abstract": "Although the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly developed, there has been little research to review, describe, and analyse the trends and development of empirical research on AI-supported language learning. This paper selected and analysed 25 empirical research papers on AI-supported language learning published in the last 15 years. These empirical studies were analysed using the activity theory from seven constituents: tool, subject, object, rules, community, division of labour, and outcome. A key contribution of this paper is the use of activity theory to illustrate the dynamic interactions and contradictions between the seven elements. AI-supported technology as a mediating tool demonstrated some effectiveness in language learning but needs further improvement in the use of language for communication and collaborative design. We argue that teachers\u2019 intervention and configuration of AI-supported language learning in the pedagogical design plays an important role in the effectiveness of learning. More research is needed to explore the use of AI-supported language learning in the classroom or the real-life learning context. Implications for practice or policy: Research on AI-supported language learning should view teacher and students as active agents in interacting with technology and making transformations in real life learning situations. More research should focus on productive dialogue and communication in AI-supported language learning with collaborative design. A mixed module of AI-supported language learning and formal teacher instruction should be incorporated in pedagogical design.",

Pedagogical agents are autonomous characters that inhabit learning environments to engage with learners in rich, face\u2010to\u2010face interactions. Building on this work, in 2000, together with our colleague Jeff Rickel, we published an article on pedagogical agents (Johnson, Rickel, and Lester 2000) that surveyed and discussed the potential of this new paradigm. We made the case that pedagogical agents that interact with learners in natural, lifelike ways can help learning environments achieve improved learning outcomes. This article has been widely cited, and was a winner of the 2017 IFAAMAS Award for Influential Papers in Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. 1 On the occasion of receiving the IFAAMAS award, and after 20 years of work on pedagogical agents, we take another look at the future of the field. We start by revisiting the predictions we made in 2000 for pedagogical agents, and examine which predictions panned out. Then, informed by what we have learned since then, we take another look at emerging trends and reexamine the future of pedagogical agents. Advances in natural language dialogue, affective computing, machine learning, virtual environments, and robotics are making possible even more lifelike and effective pedagogical agents, with potentially profound effects on the way people learn.",

      "abstract": "Educational institutions are envisioned as principal agents for addressing the current sustainability challenge that society is facing. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is transformational and concerns learning content and outcomes, pedagogy and the learning environment in itself. ESD entails rethinking the learning environment (physical and virtual) in line with sustainable development, which implies classrooms\u2019 transformation towards learner engagement, formative assessments and active methodologies. This paper responds to this need through exploring the relationship between Smart Classrooms and four widely used ESD methodologies (project or problem-based learning, case study, simulation and cooperative inquiry), identifying how the dimensions and categories of the characteristics of Smart Classrooms can contribute and lead to the implementation of ESD methodologies in real teaching practice in an effective way. The method used in this study consisted of a literature review of both theoretical frameworks separately, ESD and Smart Classrooms, and a subsequent expert analysis to identify the interrelation between both. The Smart Classroom shows a high level of adequacy for using problem and project-based learning, case study and cooperative inquiry methods because of its characteristics in terms of technology developments, environmental conditions and processes. Simulation is the ESD methodology with the lowest level of adequacy in a Smart Classroom, because it is primarily held online rather than through face-to-face teaching. Smart Education facilitates the putting in practice of ESD processes as it enables the creation of intelligent, sustainable, resource-efficient, personalised and adaptive learning environments. Further empirical research is needed to explore the influence that the Smart Classroom has in enabling ESD processes and practices, and to identify students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 needs at different education levels. Additionally, teacher training programmes focused on the correct use of Smart Classrooms and on the digital competence of teachers are critical to its successful implementation.",

This change has been effected through the following Edu-Metaverse characteristics: embodied and multimodal interaction; immersive teaching scenarios, which can accelerate learning and skill acquisition; and the emergence of AI-enabled agents. In comparison to traditional classroom teaching models, smart education is a collaborative and visual model that adopts the latest AI technologies to reach a learning outcome. However, a problem that should be considered is how a smart education model, enabled by the Edu-Metaverse, can be developed to enhance better learning outcomes for students. Such a model should highlight smart pedagogy in the context of the Edu-Metaverse, together with a smart teaching environment, multimodal teaching resources, and AI-enabled assessment. In this study, we focused on the teaching of college English to 60 students from Zhejiang Open University. We investigated the effectiveness of a smart education model, which was empowered by the Edu-Metaverse, in enhancing better learning outcomes for the students, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research. After the one-semester-long experiment, questionnaires were sent out to complement the interview findings. It was found that the students who engaged in the smart education model in the Edu-Metaverse yielded higher scores in oral English, vocabulary and grammar, reading comprehension, English-to-Chinese translation, and writing than those who engaged in traditional instruction. Therefore, this study suggests that a smart education model enabled by the Edu-Metaverse, which is characterized by a highly immersive experience, multimodal interaction, and a high degree of freedom for resource sharing and creation can help learners to realize deep learning, develop their capacity for high-order thinking, and help them to become intelligent individuals in an online learning space. In order to facilitate this smart learning, we make the following suggestions for educational institutions: (1) teachers should improve the design of teaching scenarios, (2) teachers should focus on learning assessment that is based on core literacy, and (3) teachers\u2019 knowledge of the architecture of the Edu-Metaverse should be enhanced.",

      "abstract": "We provide evidence of persistent gender effects for students using advanced adaptive technology while learning mathematics. This technology improves each gender\u2019s learning and affective predispositions toward mathematics, but specific features in the software help either female or male students. Gender differences were seen in the students\u2019 style of use of the system, motivational goals, affective needs, and cognitive/affective benefits, as well as the impact of affective interventions involving pedagogical agents. We describe 4 studies, with hundreds of students in public schools over several years, which suggest that technology responses should probably be customized to each gender. This article shows differential results before, during, and after the use of adaptive tutoring software, indicating that digital tutoring systems can be an important supplement to mathematics classrooms but that male and female students should be addressed differently. Female students were more receptive than male students to seeking and accepting help provided by the tutoring system and to spending time seeing the hints; thus, they had a consistent general trend to benefit more from it, especially when affective learning companions were present. In addition, female students expressed positively valenced emotions most often and exhibited more productive behaviors when exposed to female characters; these affective pedagogical agents encouraged effort and perseverance. This was not the case for male students, who had more positive outcomes when no learning companion was present and their worst affective and cognitive outcomes when the female character was present.",

      "abstract": "One important but under-researched area of instructional technology concerns the effects of animated pedagogical agents (APAs), or lifelike characters designed to enhance learning in computer-based environments. This research sought to broaden what is currently known about APAs' instructional value by investigating the effects of agents' visual presence and nonverbal communication. \r\nA theoretical framework based on APA literature published in the past decade guided the design of the study. This framework sets forth that APAs impact learning through their presence and communication. The communication displayed by an APA involves two distinct kinds of nonverbal cues: cognitive (hand and arm gestures) and affective (facial expressions). It was predicted that the presence of an agent would enhance learning and that nonverbal communication would amplify these effects. \r\nThe research utilized a between-subjects experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment conditions in a controlled lab setting, and group means were compared with a MANCOVA. Participants received (i) a non-animated agent, (2) an agent with hand and arm gestures, (3) an agent with facial expressions, or (4) a fully animated agent. The agent appeared in a virtual learning environment focused on Kepler's laws of planetary motion. A control group did not receive the visual presence of an agent. \r\nTwo effects were studied: participants' perceptions and their learning outcomes. Perceptions were measured with an attitudinal survey with five subscales. Learning outcomes were measured with an open-ended recall test, a multiple choice comprehension test, and an open-ended transfer test. \r\nLearners presented with an agent with affective nonverbal communication comprehended less than learners exposed to a non-animated agent. No significant differences were observed when a group exposed to a fully animated agent was compared to a group with a non-animated agent. Adding both nonverbal communication channels mitigated the disadvantages of adding just one kind of nonverbal cue. No statistically significant differences were observed on measures of recall or transfer, or on the attitudinal survey. \r\nThe research supports the notion that invoking a human-like presence in a virtual learning environment prompts strong expectations about the character's realism. When these expectations are not met, learning is hindered.",

A system of inferences of this kind is properly viewed as a theory because such states are not directly observable, and the system can be used to make predictions about the behavior of others. As to the mental states the chimpanzee may infer, consider those inferred by our own species, for example, purpose or intention , as well as knowledge, belief, thinking, doubt, guessing, pretending, liking , and so forth. To determine whether or not the chimpanzee infers states of this kind, we showed an adult chimpanzee a series of videotaped scenes of a human actor struggling with a variety of problems. Some problems were simple, involving inaccessible food \u2013 bananas vertically or horizontally out of reach, behind a box, and so forth \u2013 as in the original Kohler problems; others were more complex, involving an actor unable to extricate himself from a locked cage, shivering because of a malfunctioning heater, or unable to play a phonograph because it was unplugged. With each videotape the chimpanzee was given several photographs, one a solution to the problem, such as a stick for the inaccessible bananas, a key for the locked up actor, a lit wick for the malfunctioning heater. The chimpanzee's consistent choice of the correct photographs can be understood by assuming that the animal recognized the videotape as representing a problem, understood the actor's purpose, and chose alternatives compatible with that purpose.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The use of animated pedagogical agents in multimedia learning environments has increased as new technologies have made them more accessible (Gholson & Craig, 2002; Johnson, Rickel, & Lester, 2000). Pedagogical agents are animated life-like characters enabled with speech, gesture, movement, and human-like behaviors (Sweller, Ayres, & Kalyuga, 2011) and designed to facilitate learning in multimedia learning environments (Johnson et al., 2000). Pedagogical agents can embody different pedagogical roles to support learners by supplanting, scaffolding, coaching, testing, or demonstrating or modeling a procedure (Schroeder & Adesope, 2014). Previous studies have claimed the positive influences of pedagogical agents on student motivation and interest (Atkinson, 2002; Moreno, 2005) and also have indicated positive effects on student attitude toward learning and performance (Baylor, 2002a, 2002b; Baylor & Ryu, 2003; Moreno et al., 2001). However, other studies reported that pedagogical agents in multimedia learning could cause unnecessary cognitive load (Choi & Clark, 2006; Clark & Choi, 2005) called extraneous cognitive load. For example, the split-attention effect could occur when multiple sources of information are presented in split-attention without being integrated (Ayres & Sweller, 2014). The modality effect also can be caused when multiple sources of information are presented in single-modality not in dual modality (Low & Sweller, 2014). Both split-attention effect and modality effect are considered cognitive load effects caused by information presented through multiple information sources. According to cognitive load theory (CLT), our brain utilizes two primary types of memory, the working memory and the long term memory, to process, store, and access information (Kalyuga, 2011; Sweller, 2005; Sweller, van Merrienboer, & Paas, 1998). Due to the limited capacity of the working memory, learners must cope with a certain level of cognitive load to process newly presented information. In pedagogical agent multimedia learning, both auditory and visual channels of information can be engaged in working memory from two different sources that are pedagogical agent and on-screen multimedia material, thus influence learners' cognitive load as a whole. Cognitive load theorists (Pass, Renkl, & Sweller, 2003; Sweller, 1999, 2005) agree that three different types of cognitive load need to be considered in designing instruction: (a) intrinsic cognitive load, (b) extraneous cognitive load, and (c) germane cognitive load. Intrinsic cognitive load is imposed by the intrinsic nature of presented information or learning task itself and should be reduced (i.e., task difficulty). Extraneous cognitive load results from the ineffective instructional design and needs to be prevented (e.g., format of instructional materials). Germane cognitive load is also imposed by instructional design but is effective for learning (e.g., a learner's effortful process of understanding). The distinction between intrinsic cognitive load and germane cognitive load is not clearly made (see Sweller, Ayres, & Kalyuga, 2011) because germane cognitive load is not imposed by the nature and structure of the learning materials. However, germane cognitive load has been associated with various additional cognitive activities that are designed to foster schema acquisition (Kalyuga, 2010). Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider germane cognitive load as sources of auxiliary cognitive activities to enhance learning outcomes or to increase learner motivation (Kalyuga, 2010). Applying the types of cognitive load to designing multimedia learning environments, Mayer (2009, 2014b) suggested three kinds of cognitive processing demands in his cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) that are extraneous processing, essential processing, and generative processing (also see Moreno & Mayer, 2010). \u2026",

      "abstract": "This article reports the results of an experimental study on multimedia learning environments, which investigated the impact of increasing the social behaviors of a pedagogical agent on students' perceptions of social presence, their perceptions of the learning experience, and learning. Paradoxically, in this experiment students detected higher degrees of social presence in both the text only and the fully animated social agent conditions than students in the voice only and the static image of the agent with voice conditions. Furthermore, students had more positive perceptions of the learning experience in the text only condition. The results support the careful design of social behaviors for animated pedagogical agents if they are to be of educational value, otherwise, the use of agent technology can actually detract from the learning experience. ********** Recent research in technological learning environments has begun to focus on the educational benefits of including pedagogical software agents. The work of Reeves and Nass (1996) has demonstrated that in human-to-computer interactions, humans will anthropomorphize the software even to the extent of applying social rules of human-to-human communication to the computer agents. The application of these rules to interactions with a software agent in an electronic learning environment may have educational benefits as well. Pedagogical software agents are animated interface agents in instructional environments that draw upon human-to-human social communication scripts by embodying observable human characteristics (such as the use of gestures and facial expressions). Research in the past few years on the use of pedagogical software agents has expanded to cover a variety of pedagogical roles taken on by the agent. The Teachable Agent Group at Vanderbilt (TAG-V) has developed social agents who play the role of the tutee rather than the tutor. In this environment where students learn by teaching, students are able to adjust the agent's attitude, and teach him or her relevant skills and concepts. The Tutoring Research Group at the University of Memphis, under Art Grasser, has developed a system called AutoTutor, which uses conversational agents that act as dialogue partners to assist learners in the active construction of knowledge. The Pedagogical Agent Learning Systems (PALS) laboratory at the University of Florida, under Amy Baylor, has developed a multiple agent environment called Multiple Intelligent Mentors Instructing Collaboratively (MIMIC) in which the agents act as mentors to students. Research on the MIMIC environment has focused on manipulating the characteristics of the agents such as programming the agents to offer feedback from an instructivist and constructivist theoretical perspective (Baylor, 2002). Baylor has also investigated the impact of using multiple agents that serve as experts and/or motivators to students (Baylor & Ebbers, 2003). The agents in all of the aforementioned environments are responsive to user input. However, even in a more didactic electronic teaching environment, agents can maintain motivational and affective features. According to Atkinson (2002): In particular, may be possible to structure an example-based learning environment so that a lifelike character can exploit verbal (e.g., instructional explanations) as well as nonverbal forms of communication (e.g., gaze, gesture) within the examples themselves in an effort to promote a learner's motivation toward the task and his or her cognitive engagement in it. (p. 416) In traditional classroom settings it is difficult to deny that teaching by its very nature involves some sort of intervention in the learning process of students in an attempt to facilitate their acquisition of desired educational outcomes (Shuell, 1996). One form that this intervention takes is providing cues as to which in the material being studied is most important and the manner in which students might process the information (p. \u2026",

Qualitative results provided insight into this finding, while indicating the complexity of deploying pedagogical agents in educational settings.",

      "abstract": "Preparing medical students to be agentic learners is held to be increasingly important. This is because beyond sequencing, enhancing and varying of experiences across university and health care settings, medical students require epistemological agency to optimise their learning. The positioning of students in these settings, and their engagement with these is central to effective medical education. Consequently, when considering both the processes and outcomes of individuals' learning to become a doctor, it is helpful to account for the interrelated pedagogical factors of affordance, guidance, and engagement. Firstly, are the kinds of experiences and interactions that are provided for individuals, referred to here as affordances. Secondly, is how students are guided through these affordances. Finally, how students take up what is afforded them, referred to here as engagement is central to their learning. This paper focuses on the last set of concerns - the bases of student engagement - with particular consideration to how they shape the relations between what experiences (i.e. interactions and activities) are afforded through the medical program and how they elect to engage with them. Evidence from a qualitative study is used to present five salient factors that are central to assist medical students prepare as agentic learners.",

In a 2 (neutral vs. enthusiastic expressions) \u00d7 2 (female vs. male agent) between-subject design with additional consideration of the gender of the learner, data of 129 participants was collected. Results revealed that the manipulation of enthusiasm lead to higher perceptions of positive emotions. In addition, a pedagogical agent who performed enthusiastic expressions led to a higher retention but not transfer performance. In terms of the gender of the agent and the learner, male learners retained knowledge better when they watched the agent performing enthusiastic expression irrespective of the persona gender. Female learners, however, retained knowledge only better when a female agent performed enthusiastic expressions.

The paper recognizes current research in HPE and refers to the long-standing positioning of (successful) 'learning' at the forefront of subjects, activities and curriculum (Hayes, Capel, Katene, & Cook, 2006). It explores gaps and potential in 'pedagogical work' (Tinning, 2008) and 'pedagogic action' (Penney, 2013) that may prioritize and legitimate, or challenge, how topics, curriculum, assessment and activities can be emphasized over learning. It argues that foregrounding educative outcomes requires knowledge building in relation to curriculum, pedagogy and assessment; that the significance of the interplay and alignment of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment is key to attaining educative outcomes; and that the notions of cumulative and segmented learning (Maton, 2011) in HPE deserve exploration. A text analysis of sections of the Consultation document will be utilized to demonstrate how learning is potentially the bonding agent, how curriculum documents make it legitimate (or not) and how comprehensive and developmental learning are situated in the text. In addition, excerpts from a case study of student and teacher voices in one school event is utilized to raise and provoke discussion about student learning, perceptions about learning in HPE and raise challenges about the interplay between curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. The final section of the paper proposes challenges for teachers of HPE with issues to consider in generating 'pedagogic action' (Penney, 2013) for educative outcomes in HPE.",

It is now known that learning is associated not only with cognitive ability but also with affect. The incorporation of affective embodied pedagogical agents (EPAs) in computer programs for learning can significantly influence learner beliefs and efficacy. However, there have been a number of criticisms and contradictory empirical findings calling into question earlier results and theoretical claims on the effectiveness of using EPAs. Therefore, this paper reviewed studies that evaluated the effectiveness of affect in EPAs in a computer-based learning environment (CLE). The statistical meta-analytic review ( k = 30, n = 2,150) found that the use of affect in EPAs has a significant and moderate impact ( r = .35) on students\u2019 learning motivation and a relatively smaller impact on knowledge retention ( r = .29) and knowledge transfer ( r = .26). The effect sizes of the three outcome variables in this review are stronger compared with previous meta-analysis on the impact of the embodiment level of EPAs, indicating that the use of affect is more desirable and effective in CLEs. Finally, implications for both designers and researchers of using affective EPAs in CLEs are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Early researchers suggested that virtual humans (animated pedagogical agents) required a persona if they were to be anthropomorphized by the user. Over the past two decades, research has focused on design features that target the perception of persona in order to increase the anthropomorphization of the agent toward the end of increased learning outcomes. This systematic narrative review analyzes studies that have measured agent persona using the Agent Persona Instrument to assess whether there is evidence that persona increases learning outcomes. Our findings suggest that significantly higher persona ratings have little effect on learning outcomes. However, design features such as facial expressions and gestures were more important moderators of agent persona than voice and agent type, and environmental details such as study domain or student population suggested no clear direction in the perception of persona. The article concludes with a discussion of future directions for study designs and potential frontiers.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the impact of embodied pedagogical agents on learning outcomes. Most review studies have evaluated learning outcomes from the perspective of testing labels such as transfer, retention, recognition, free recall, and various other classifications. This is problematic, because studies can be excluded due to the labeling of the assessment, even though the testing format and test taking strategy are the same. This meta-analysis assesses how embodied pedagogical agents impact learning when measured from the testing format and test taking strategy perspective. The new approach, along with new moderating variables to evaluate agent design and content information, supports previous findings that embodied pedagogical agents significantly increase learning; but there are limitations depending on the agent\u2019s design and the type of information being learned. This meta-analysis advances the field by exploring new ways to think about design elements associated with embodied pedagogical agents.",

      "abstract": "1. This paper argues that the most powerful, durable and effective agents of educational change are not the policy makers, the curriculum developers or even the education authorities themselves; they are the teachers. It further contends that the quality of the educational changes that teachers have the skills and opportunities to effect will only be as reliable and proficient as the teachers' individual capacities for reflective practice and the development of self knowledge. These aspects of teacher development have, historically, been largely overlooked in the preparation and promotion of effective teachers. The emphasis has been more explicitly focused on the development and demonstration of teachers' understanding of content knowledge and the associated pedagogies and in their capacities to understand their students as individual constructors of knowledge in diverse social contexts. Whilst the former teacher characteristics have traditionally been valued as desirable or even mandatory indicators of teacher quality, the latter are heavily impacted upon by the individual pedagogue's values, attitudes and notions of what it is to be a professional practitioner. In order for teachers to be effective in the Information Age, they need to recognize more than just their students' background and learning preferences. They need to be able to take effective, positive action in the classroom context to improve the educational outcomes for their students. In order to do this they must have the willingness and cognitive capacities to recognize ethical dilemmas and examine their own perspectives on the issues they face critically and analytically. This requires regular, authentic reflection. The reflective process in which one teacher engaged as part of his role in a research study is documented. ..",

      "abstract": "It is arguably human nature\u2014and most certainly bureaucratic nature\u2014to want to quantify our successes and failures. The ability to calculate a numerical value to represent the progress of an individual or an institution, a country even, is now central to evidence-based policy and practice. The counterpoint to \"treasuring what we measure,\" is of course, \"what counts can't always be measured, and what's measurable doesn't always count.\" All institutions, education being no exception, have long wrestled with the tension that the powerful abstractions afforded by quantitative analysis also lose vital detail as context is stripped out. This is what makes the design of metrics to gauge the quality of nuanced human processes and outcomes (such as teaching and learning) so controversial. Across society, we see this debate now playing out in all spheres of human life, with ethical frameworks and professional codes of practice proliferating (eg, Asilomar, 2017; Floridi et al., 2018; IEEE, 2017; Montreal, 2017; Partnership on AI [PAI], 2018)\u2014although it is not clear that these are making much impact yet on computing companies (Whittaker et al., 2018, Section 2.3). How this debate should unfold in education and lifelong learning is the focus of this special issue, which brings together leading scholars in the field of Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED)\u2014fields that are viewed with varying degrees of excitement and suspicion by parents, students, teachers, journalists and scholars. The fears are reasonable: that quantification and autonomous systems provide a new wave of power tools to track and quantify human activity in ever higher resolution\u2014a dream for bureaucrats, marketeers and researchers\u2014but offer little to advance everyday teaching and learning in productive directions. This fear is justified in our post-Snowden era of pervasive surveillance, and post-Cambridge Analytica data breaches. Partly however, this fear is also born of lack of awareness about the diverse forms that LA/AIED take, which is equally understandable\u2014to outsiders, these are new and opaque technologies. It follows that if we do not want to see concerned students, parents and unions protesting against AI in education, we need urgently to communicate in accessible terms what the benefits of these new tools are, and equally, how seriously the community is engaging with their potential to be used to the detriment of society. Politics, Pedagogy and Practices cannot, of course, be neatly split into separate analytical threads: they are mutually constitutive. Building on the critical analyses of information infrastructures (Bowker & Star, 1999; Star & Ruhleder, 1996) and knowledge infrastructures (Edwards, 2010; Edwards et al., 2013), we may now be seeing the emergence of \"educational knowledge infrastructures\" (Buckingham Shum, 2018)\u2014these only exert political power through practices (in policy and design), which translate educational worldviews (whether implicitly or explicitly recognised: Knight, Buckingham Shum, & Littleton, 2014) into code (eg, in database schemas, algorithms and user interfaces), involving and excluding stakeholders, for instance, through the networks of institutions funding and building such infrastructure (Luckin & Cukurova, 2019; Prinsloo, 2019; Williamson, 2019), and the design methodologies employed to make design decisions (Buckingham Shum, Ferguson, & Martinez-Maldonado, 2019; Richards & Dignum, 2019; Mavrikis, Geraniou, Gutierrez Santos, & Poulovassilis, 2019). In the context of this 50th Anniversary Special Issue of the British Journal of Educational Technology, authors from a range of disciplinary backgrounds and outlooks were challenged to make the state of the art in their fields accessible to a broad audience, and to give glimpses of the road ahead to 2025. The papers are therefore primarily reflective, \"big picture\" narratives, reviewing and discussing existing literature and case studies, and looking forward to what could, or should, be on the horizon. Together, they provide an eclectic set of lenses for thinking about LA/AIED at a range of scales\u2014from the macroscale of national and international policy and stakeholder networks, to the meso-scale of institutional strategy, down to the micro-scale of how we make cognitive models more intelligible, or design decisions more ethical. These papers thus provide a complement to the BJET 'sister' special issue on LA/AIED (Star\u010di\u010d, 2019), which provides a more conventional set of papers reporting new empirical evidence and technical advances. We start with two papers from the perspective of critical data studies and sociotechnical infrastructure analysis. In \"Policy networks, performance metrics, and platform markets: Charting the expanding data infrastructure of higher education,\" Williamson (2019) recognises that while educational data scientists (such as those in this special issue) are genuine in their pursuit of student/teacher-centred LA/AIED, the politicisation and commercialisation of national and international scale data infrastructure cannot be ignored. Drawing on a UK programme currently underway, Williamson highlights numerous concerns, such as how LA/AIED technology may in fact be appropriated by other agendas, and translated into performance metrics. Consequently, he calls for policy frameworks for ethical, pedagogically valuable uses of student data in higher education. In \"A social cartography of analytics in education as performative politics,\" Prinsloo (2019) critiques \"the data imaginary\" in higher education, arguing that this narrative ascribes too much trust and power in the potential of data analysis to represent the complex reality of student progress. Following an analysis of the main assumptions in evidence-based management, and the increasing power of quantitative metrics, he presents a \"social cartography\" of data analytics, which should be thought of \"not only as representational, but as actant, and as performative politics.\" The changing ecosystem of stakeholders who constitute LA/AIED continues as the focus in \"Designing Educational Technologies in the Age of AI: A Learning Sciences Driven Approach,\" by Luckin and Cukurova (2019). Educational technology companies are interpreting ideas that have been in research labs for decades, and powered by big data and data science, are taking products to market. This is both exciting and dangerous, since as the authors put it, \"most commercial AI developers know little about Learning Sciences research, indeed they often know little about learning or teaching.\" Luckin and Cukurova present three examples illustrating how the learning sciences assist in making sense of rich learner data traces, before discussing models for the more effective sharing of such academic knowledge in forms that can be applied by LA/AIED companies, by forging inter-stakeholder partnerships between developers, educators and researchers. LA/AIED is now in commercial products and robust open source platforms, making them ready for adoption at scale\u2014but what does this process look like? The innovation capacity of individual higher education institutions comes into focus in \"Complexity leadership in learning analytics: Drivers, challenges, and opportunities,\" by Tsai, Poquet, Ga\u0161evi\u0107, Dawson, and Pardo (2019). They document the organisational enablers and obstacles to sustained adoption, and the forms of leadership required to navigate such organisational change. Drawing on their analysis of 21 universities' adoption processes, and 23 leadership interviews, they distil some common, critical challenges, in the light of which they argue that leadership models based on complexity theory provide key principles to accelerate sustainable LA. Data ethics run throughout this special issue, but the next paper makes this the central focus. In \"Practical ethics for building learning analytics,\" Kitto and Knight (2019) identify several tensions (illustrated by \"edge cases\") in current thinking about ethics in relation to LA/AIED, focussing in particular on how current frameworks fail to provide practical guidance for the teams who design and build such infrastructure. They propose an open database of such edge cases, as \"a middle space where technical builders of systems could more deeply interface with those concerned with policy, law and ethics.\" Attention then switches to the new societal challenge of learning for a lifetime, and its implications for how LA/AIED is conceived. In \"From data to personal user models for life-long, life-wide learners,\" Kay and Kummerfeld (2019) map out new challenges for the AIED community, specifically, how the established concept of \"the learner model\" (what the AI believes the learner understands) must evolve. They identify a set of \"competency questions\" to which learners should be able to get intelligible answers, if they have genuine control over their learning data, and be equipped to use it to scaffold metacognitive processes. One of the most visible forms of AI that the public now engages with are software agents, for instance, automating telephone and textchat helplines, and enabling voice interfaces to smartphones and other devices. In \"Supporting and challenging learners through pedagogical agents who know their learner: Addressing ethical issues through designing for values,\" Richards and Dignum (2019) explain what is currently known about the effective use of pedagogical agents (PAs) in learning environments. They describe the different forms these agents can take, what roles they play, the underlying theories, and how they may develop in the future. Richards and Dignum then weave ethical considerations into this picture, arguing for a \"design for values\" approach to the design of ethically and socially responsible agents. As we introduced above, there is a belief, held in certain scholarly communities and some of the teaching profession, that LA/AIED equates to intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), delivered through a narrow, instructivist pedagogical model focussed on skills mastery through \"drill and practice.\" ITS (often branded \"adaptive learning\") may also be seen as particularly threatening to the teaching profession, since the value proposition is to more efficiently handle the task of guiding the learner to master the curriculum with 24/7 coaching feedback. Tackling these concerns heads on in \"Escape from the Skinner Box: The case for contemporary intelligent learning environments,\" du Boulay (2019) first summarises key evidence from 40 years' ITS research. He turns next to examples of more diverse pedagogies that operate at the \"screen level\" (the capabilities of an ITS), and the \"classroom level\" (how teachers can orchestrate the students' ITS experience in different ways). The agency of both students and teachers in these scenarios is greater than the reductionist image that critics paint. The question of the pedagogical assumptions underpinning LA/AIED continues in \"Intelligent Analysis and Data Visualisation for Teacher Assistance tools: The case of exploratory learning,\" by Mavrikis et al. (2019). Tackling together the concerns around pedagogy, and the automation of teachers, the authors describe how LA can be designed to augment teachers' awareness of their students' progress in exploratory learning tasks. They describe the design rationale behind a suite of \"Teacher Assistance tools,\" and their empirical evaluation in use. The ITS theme continues in part in a third paper, with a critical reflection on how the AIED community makes its models more transparent, and the criteria used to judge the quality of intelligent systems. In \"Explanatory learner models: Why machine learning (alone) is not the answer,\" Ros\u00e9 et al. (2019) argue for \"explanatory learner models\" that provide more interpretable, actionable output than \"black box\" models, which may be inscrutable even to their own developers. They present examples of how their systems accomplish this with different kinds of data, across mathematics and writing courses, in order to improve the learner model, generate actionable feedback, and critically, keep the human \"in the loop,\" rather than automate them out. Distinctively, the authors describe how other disciplines (social sciences, education and design) have contributed important insights and algorithmic improvements, by evaluating AIED in authentic contexts. They conclude that LA/AIED tools should be designed and evaluated with such interdisciplinary skillsets, to understand the human dimensions of use that more technology-centric approaches miss. We explicitly called for insider accounts from system builders regarding the assumptions they make about \"politics, pedagogy and practices.\" In \"The heart of educational data infrastructures = conscious humanity and scientific responsibility, not infinite data and limitless experimentation,\" Johanes and Thille (2019) describe not their own system building efforts, but the insights they gained from in-depth interviews with 11 data infrastructure teams building LA/AIED systems. The authors seek to give these teams a voice, to rebalance concerns that technologists do not care about ethics, or even if they do, they cannot translate this into design decisions. Their goal is that \"researchers, policymakers, and infrastructure builders can use these accounts to better understand the building process and experience.\" They document how infrastructure developers reflect deeply on, and ultimately make decisions about, the social and ethical dimensions of their creations. We invited papers that would provide critical accounts of the practices employed in the design of LA/AIED, and of the practices adopted by educators deploying these tools (Kay & Kummerfeld, 2019; Luckin & Cukurova, 2019; Richards & Dignum, 2019; Ros\u00e9 et al., 2019). With respect to pedagogy, we anticipated critical narratives that explain how the use of quantification does not need to equate to the implementation of behaviourist or instructivist approaches to teaching and learning (du Boulay, 2019; Mavrikis et al., 2019). Finally, within the theme of politics, our goal was to garner accounts that recognise the political significance and the potential for power and influence that the intelligence infrastructure constructed through the use of big data, AI and analytics brings to the world. Accounts that would help us to be appropriately vigilant and judiciously embracing with respect to these technologies and the quantifiable approaches they can bring to education (Kitto & Knight, 2019; Prinsloo, 2019; Richards & Dignum, 2019; Tsai et al., 2019; Williamson, 2019). We were also keen for clarifications of the way that the three elements of our theme: Politics, Pedagogy and Practices are deeply connected and inter-related (cf. Johanes & Thille, 2019; Kitto & Knight, 2019). The politics/policy making theme was very popular with authors, who addressed the policies that need to be in place to tackle concerns about marketisation, the use of data to control and reform, and the need to rethink the way we approach ethics, far beyond issues of privacy. We need to equip decision makers to really understand data, and to ask critical, data-literate questions. Policy makers will be pleased to read the call for dialogue\u2014between institution leaders, policy professionals, academics, pedagogical experts and students\u2014in order to address the need for evolving data infrastructures that precipitate tension between on the one hand, student-empowerment, and on the other, the quantification of HE through data-driven metrics (Williamson, 2019). Dialogue between multiple stakeholders is essential to ensure increased understanding as we venture into uncharted educational territory, although we should never underestimate the fact that higher education institutions are complex adaptive systems, as made clear by Tsai et al. (2019). Prinsloo (2019) echoes this, highlighting the need to pay attention to making visible and relevant the social, political, economic, legal, technological and environmental context that \"entangles\" all that we do. The key role to be played by multiple stakeholders, within school education as well as within HE, also arises for Mavrikis et al. Their paper discusses the way in which teachers can be assisted by well-designed information visualisations driven by sound LA, and how teachers need to be part of the conversation when it comes to the design and implementation of data driven approaches within education. Surely, however, all these political concerns need to be guided by the \"North Star\" of pedagogy that we must put in place to achieve the future benefits that analytics and AI can potentially bring? As we move through the 21st century and embrace the fourth industrial revolution, we need to think carefully about pedagogy. It is important that we continually question the drivers behind all the discussions about politics and policy, and ensure that they are led by what we know and understand about pedagogy. If we do not address this focus, then we may make decisions that yield unintended and unwanted consequences. Delightfully, du Boulay (2019) challenges the statement made in the call for papers for this special issue that: \"\u2026 analytics and AI equate to adopting a retrograde pedagogy from the industrial era\u2026\". Du Boulay probes and discusses the developments in pedagogy that can be found in interactive learning environments, proposing that future educational directions could benefit from fostering the learner's motivation, and tapping into their curiosity through the way we design, organise and choreograph their learning activities. It will be important that new technologies reduce rather than increase the workload of hard-pressed teachers, a point echoed by Mavrikis et al. (2019). A particularly valuable aspect of the reflective approach we asked authors to take can be seen in the way that the papers in this issue build on much previous valuable research. For example, Kay and Kummerfeld combine earlier work on Open Learner Models from AI in Education with research on Personal Informatics to formulate the idea of a Personal User Model for Life-long, Life-wide Learners (PUML) and produce a set of design guidelines with the aim of helping learners to develop their metacognitive skills as well as gaining control of their data. In particular, they focus on the need for appropriate interfaces that support self-monitoring, reflection and data scrutiny and control. The work is conceptual, but draws together previous research form AI and Human Computer interaction effectively in support of their proposals. We see a similar call, for deep interdisciplinarity, in the work of Ros\u00e9 et al., who highlight the need for the success criteria of the machine learning paradigm to be tempered with those of authentic assessment in education (see also Kitto, Buckingham Shum, & Gibson, 2018). When it comes to the practices of teaching and learning with analytics and AI, and the practices involved in building analytics and AI technologies, then we certainly need to ensure that we are connected in our thinking. We need the educators to be talking with the developers and builders, and this joint narrative must speak to policy making. To this point, the paper by Richards and Dignum about the societal impact and ethical issues that must be taken into account when designing PAs feels internationally relevant. The authors acknowledge that we do not yet understand the implications of PAs in human roles for supporting both teachers and and as lifelong They that both and policy makers need to be of both the benefits and with the use of PAs AI in and present a design approach in the of learner They highlight the challenge of of learning between education and the and the potential benefit that and reality could bring to help address this They make a case for the value of but they also recognise the need for and tools to ensure responsible Johanes and Thille also focus on the need for between different They that those who build data driven and analytics technology only data as and ready for rather than as products of social processes.

It looks at three different urban master\u2019s programs in Serbia (Belgrade) and Germany (Berlin and Stuttgart). Design/methodology/approach In this paper, students' assessments of the pedagogical model, individual learning outcomes and the long-term value of the pedagogical model in respect of key competences for sustainability are presented and discussed. Basic assumptions of the study include that assessment from the students' perspective can provide feedback on the transformational learning experience with the aim of improving the experience and thus learning outcomes; help identify limitations and target specific areas for improvement in the pedagogical model; and improve the evaluation of effectiveness in developing knowledge and skills for sustainability in HPE. Findings The paper provides evidence that a learner-centered and action-oriented approach, as well as a global dialogue among peers from different backgrounds and nationalities, is an effective way to educate future generations of urban planners to become \u201cchange agents\u201d for societal transformation toward a more sustainable future within their respective contexts. Originality/value The paper is a supplement to the existing research on educational initiatives that attempts to integrate sustainability into the curricula, especially of urban-related programs; showcases outcomes of the pedagogical model(s) for sustainable development applied, especially when addressing the competences of students working in developing, transitional and developed countries or different geographic contexts; and shows long-term learning outcomes after the students move into work practice.",

The roles were evaluated according to three contrast comparisons, comparing the value of the agents with and without motivation, the value of the agents with and without expertise, and the overall value of the Mentor agent (which combined motivation and expertise). Results indicated that the motivational agents (Motivator & Mentor) were significantly more engaging, human-like and facilitative of learning than the Expert agent, yet were also less credible. The agents with expertise (Expert & Mentor) were significantly more credible, and led to better performance on the transfer measure than the Motivator agent, yet were also less supportive and less human-like. Overall, the Mentor was perceived as significantly more engaging and facilitative of learning than the other two agents, and also led to significantly better transfer performance.",

In addition, a limited research study on learning outcomes is discussed as well as constraints in using this pedagogical approach. Concept mapping is widely used in other disciplines as an enriching learning tool to help students organize information and develop higher-order thinking skills. It involves a process of externalizing, through drawing and diagrams, the mental connections and association patterns that a student makes on knowledge learned (Angelo and Cross, 1993). It is an innovative classroom pedagogy that promotes development of self-learning and life-long learning skills sought by the early change agents in our profession, validated more recently in the joint AAA, AICPA, IMA report (Albrecht and Sack, 2000).

The current study advances our research by applying our methodology to pedagogy research: we investigate individual and social factors underlying outcomes of implementing collaborative-inquiry classroom practice. Using bifocal modeling (Blikstein & Wilensky, 2006a), we juxtapose agent-based simulations of collaborative problem solving with real-classroom data of students' collaboration in a demographically diverse middle-school mathematics classroom (Abrahamson & Wilensky, 2005b). We validate the computer model by comparing outcomes from running the simulation with outcomes of the real intervention. Findings are that collaboration pedagogy emphasizing group performance may forsake individual learning, because stable division-of-labor patterns emerge due to utilitarian preference of short-term production over long-term learning (Axelrod, 1997).

This interdisciplinary curriculum approach employed \u2018ethical dilemma story pedagogy\u2019 in a STEAM education project designed to engage students in values-based chemistry learning. Drawing on the arts, specially written ethical dilemma stories posing real-world environmental problems engaged students in exploring their value systems. Students reflected on the pros and cons of ethical dilemmas related to the everyday use of artificial fertilizers, disposal of used cooking oil and detergent waste, and environmental pollution caused by plastic waste. The purpose of the study was to investigate the potential of the Ethical Dilemma STEAM Teaching Model to empower Indonesian secondary school students with both chemistry knowledge and transdisciplinary capabilities for resolving environmental problems. The researchers conducted an interpretive case study of four high-school chemistry classes to understand students\u2019 learning experiences and outcomes. Data were obtained from students\u2019 reflective journals, semi-structured interviews, and classroom observations. The results demonstrate that students engaged in deep chemistry learning while simultaneously developing critical reflective social thinking, collaborative decision-making skills, and increased awareness of the need to protect the environment in order to support sustainable development. The study revealed that chemistry education can play a strategic role through ethical values learning in empowering students to become agents of change for environmental sustainability. Further research is warranted into the efficacy of the Ethical Dilemma STEAM Teaching Model for empowering students in sustainability education across a broad range of science-related topics and sociocultural contexts.",

As such, an increasing amount of social human\u2013robot interaction research is being conducted in the learning domain, particularly with children. However, it is unclear precisely what social behavior a robot should employ in such interactions. Inspiration can be taken from human\u2013human studies; this often leads to an assumption that the more social behavior an agent utilizes, the better the learning outcome will be. We apply a nonverbal behavior metric to a series of studies in which children are taught how to identify prime numbers by a robot with various behavioral manipulations. We find a trend, which generally agrees with the pedagogy literature, but also that overt nonverbal behavior does not account for all learning differences. We discuss the impact of novelty, child expectations, and responses to social cues to further the understanding of the relationship between robot social behavior and learning. We suggest that the combination of nonverbal behavior and social cue congruency is necessary to facilitate learning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing technologies have fuelled the growth of Pedagogical Conversational Agents (PCAs) with empathic conversational capabilities. However, no systematic literature review has explored the intersection between conversational agents, education and emotion. Therefore, this study aimed to outline the key aspects of designing, implementing and evaluating these agents. The data sources were empirical studies, including peer\u2010reviewed conference papers and journal articles, and the most recent publications, from the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, SpringerLink, Taylor &amp; Francis Online, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library. The remaining papers underwent a rigorous quality assessment. A filter study meeting the objective was based on keywords. Comparative analysis and synthesis of results were used to handle data and combine study outcomes. Out of 1162 search results, 13 studies were selected. The results indicate that agents promote dialogic learning, proficiency in knowledge domains, personalized feedback and empathic abilities as essential design principles. Most implementations employ a quantitative approach, and two variables are used for evaluation. Feedback types play a vital role in achieving positive results in learning performance and student perceptions. The main limitations and gaps are the time range for literature selection, the level of integration of the empathic field and the lack of a detailed development stage report. Moreover, future directions are the ethical implications of agents operating beyond scheduled learning times and the adoption of Responsible AI principles. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive framework of empathic PCAs, mostly in their evaluation. The systematic review registration number is osf.io/3xk6a . Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Emotions play a pivotal role in shaping the interaction process, making it essential to consider them when designing methodological strategies or learning tools. Empathic Pedagogical Conversational Agents (PCAs) have emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing and personalizing the learning experience (24/7) for pupils and supporting human teachers in their teaching process. Despite the creation of numerous empathic PCAs, there is a scarcity of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) on their application in the educational field, particularly concerning the integration of emotional abilities in combination with the competencies of each subject. What this paper adds It offers new insights into the design principles underlying the integration of the empathic field. It reviews different approaches for incorporating students' prior knowledge in real time. It provides a comprehensive and up\u2010to\u2010date overview of the research designs used for implementation, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. It examines the factors that influence the effectiveness of empathic PCA in teaching and learning. It evaluates the types of feedback that enhance the impact of the empathic field on learning outcomes. Implications for practice and/or policy It is crucial to grasp the topics that this paper introduces in order to effectively integrate new learning tools into any context. Techno\u2010pedagogical designers seeking to gain insights into empathic PCAs will find immense value in this SLR, as it comprehensively covers each stage of the process. For future research endeavours, this study offers a wealth of ideas to draw upon, enabling researchers to address the challenges outlined and explore new avenues of investigation.",

One powerful social cue has been agent gesturing. While most agents are created only to use deictic (pointing) gestures, there is recent evidence that agents that perform all gesture types (iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and beat) with enhanced frequency help foreign language users learn more procedural knowledge. Therefore, this research examines how all gesture types and different frequencies influence agent persona and learning outcomes when foreign language users learn declarative knowledge. The results indicated that the use of gestures, regardless of frequency, significantly increase agent persona. However, gesture frequency produced conflicting learning outcomes. While enhancing gestures were beneficial for cued recall and recognition, the average gesture condition was not, which indicates that the strength of social cues is important.",

A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students' needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.",

Although this might be beneficial for native English\u2010speaking students who possess high levels of comprehension, only using pointing gestures with foreign language students learning English is problematic because these students need more assistance with language comprehension than just directing spatial awareness. The purpose of this study was to explore how gesture type and gesture frequency help foreign language students perceive the agent\u2019s persona and the ability to recall procedural information. The results found one significant interaction between average gestures and no gesture in terms of facilitation, but all other conditions and persona subscales were not significant. For learning outcomes, the enhanced gesture condition significantly recalled more information than the no gesture condition ( p = 0.017), and was approaching significance with the conversational gesture condition ( p = 0.059). The findings suggest that when the learning population consists of foreign language students, pedagogical agents should use representational and beat gestures to help students comprehend more of the language, and the gesture frequency needs to be increased to account for the lack of verbal listening skills with this population.",

Reinforcement learning is used to improve various aspects of the CBR module - cases are learned and retrieval and adaptation are improved, thus modifying the pedagogical strategies based on empirical feedback on each tutoring session. To minimize canceling out effects due to the multiple strategies used for meta-learning - for example, the learning result of one strategy undoes or reduces the impact of the learning result of another strategy, a principled design that is both cautious and prioritized is put in place. An ITS application, called Intelligent Learning Material Delivery Agent (ILMDA), has been implemented, powered by this framework, on introductory computer science topics, and deployed at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Nebraska.

      "abstract": "Active learning pedagogies are shown to enhance the outcomes of students, particularly in disciplines known for high attrition rates. Despite the demonstrated benefits of active learning, didactic lecture continues to predominate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. Change agents and professional development programs have historically placed emphasis on develop\u2013disseminate efforts for the adoption of research-based instructional strategies (RBIS). With numerous reported barriers and motivators for trying out and adopting active learning, it is unclear to what extent these factors are associated with adoption of RBIS and the effectiveness of change strategies. We present the results of a large-scale, survey-based study of introductory chemistry, mathematics, and physics instructors and their courses in the United States. Herein, we evaluate the association of 17 malleable factors with the tryout and adoption of RBIS. Multilevel logistic regression analyses suggest that several contextual, personal, and teacher thinking factors are associated with different stages of RBIS adoption. These results are also compared with analogous results evaluating the association of these factors with instructors\u2019 time spent lecturing. We offer actionable implications for change agents to provide targeted professional development programming and for institutional leaders to influence the adoption of active learning pedagogies in introductory STEM courses.",

This article delves into how tertiary English teachers in Thailand practice their agency in response to the abrupt conversion to online teaching amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This study drew on teachers\u2019 responses to a questionnaire (n=162) and semi-structure interviews (n=3) to identify their positioning and agentic actions. The results suggest that teachers\u2019 positioning as being professionally responsible for students\u2019 learning outcomes remains intact, even though the situation restricted them from going beyond their fundamental responsibilities. From a pedagogical standpoint, teachers\u2019 agentic actions identified were endeavoring to create an interactive learning environment;implementing social media platforms to compensate for the loss of face-to-face communication;working with students to adjust their teaching practices;promoting autonomous learning;and incorporating formative assessment approaches. Teachers might find themselves struggling to achieve their pedagogical goals, but once they become familiar with the new learning environment and master suitable teaching methods, online learning can be a viable option for formal language education, even in the normal situation. \u00a9 2021, Teaching English with Technology.

      "abstract": "Prior research has shown that the more patients know about their disease, health, and lifestyle the better the health outcomes are. Patients who are suffering from either a physical disease with mental consequences or from mental illnesses can contribute to their own feeling of mental well-being by following evidence-based online, self-guided therapeutic interventions. These self-guided therapeutic interventions during which there is no contact with a care provider have shown high effectiveness. However, users (patients) of self-guided eHealth interventions have difficulties fulfilling the entire trajectory as is mirrored in high non-adherence rates. Users have reported a need for support, that is traditionally provided by human care providers. This study investigates the opportunities from within the technology to increase its support level toward the user. We deployed a pedagogical agent acting as an adjunct to a self-guided positive psychology psycho-education intervention. This agent provided instructions and user support in between and explicitly not during the online learning modules as to mitigate the risk of distraction. By setting up a between-subjects design and deploying three versions of a pedagogical agent (also known as Embodied Conversational Agent), varying the features of animation, speech, and visibility we investigated whether users felt more supported than by a fourth text-only control condition. All four conditions provided similar task-related support and emotion-related support to the user. Our results showed that our pedagogical agent made users feel guided and supported with respect to fulfilling their tasks. However, no effects were found of emotion-related support resulting in higher user motivation and an improved learning experience. Significant effects of visibility and voice were found, but animation of our pedagogical agent had no effect. On the feedback outcome variable, we found a gender effect. Male participants graded the <i>visible</i> Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) <i>higher</i> than female participants and graded the <i>non-visible</i> ECA <i>lower</i> than female participants. In our view, ECA's should not necessarily be deployed with the ambition to compete with the profound human potential to deliver support and guidance. Exploring ECA capabilities merits further attention, from the stance that the technology itself can support users and potentially make them adhere.",

      "abstract": "Artificial agents, such as voice-controlled conversational agents (VCAs) built into smart devices, are becoming more prevalent in daily and educational contexts, enhancing the possibility of using them as language partners. However, research has primarily focused on the cognitive or affective outcomes of using these agents, overlooking questions about language learners' perceptions of agents as human-like conversational partners and about what aspects of agents generate the social interaction schema required for language learning. To address these gaps, this exploratory study examined to what extent EFL students perceived a VCA as a human-like language partner and what knowledge regarding language partners these students used to justify their perceptions. Sixty-seven Korean EFL students, all of them being nine years old, completed three interactional tasks with a VCA designed to act as a language partner. They then participated in a drawing task and in-depth interview implemented to explore students' perceptions toward the VCA as a language partner. Thematic analysis of students' drawings and interview transcripts found that the majority of students identified human elements in the VCA, perceiving it either as a human-like partner or as something between artifact and human. This strong tendency toward anthropomorphism indicates VCAs' great potential as interactive language partners in EFL contexts. Additionally, this study discusses the reasons for and implications of students' strong anthropomorphism tendency and how students used their knowledge regarding language partners to justify their VCA perceptions. Future recommendations for the use of VCAs were suggested from both pedagogical and technological standpoints.",

A rigorous screening process yielded six quantitative studies that met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicate that embodied, animated, and role-specific PAs can positively impact learning outcomes, aligning with theories such as situated learning and dual coding. However, the impact of PA realism and smiling expressions was less conclusive, highlighting the importance of emotional congruence and contextual factors, which will be further explored through social intelligence and politeness strategies. Moreover, this review underscores the importance of theoretical grounding in PA design and implementation. While effect sizes varied, overall findings suggest a need for future research to explore optimal PA design, the integration of emerging technologies, and address critical ethical considerations.

Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners\u2019 retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its human-like qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility.

Additionally, VDHPAs were found to improve retention (g = 0.451), transfer (g = 0.288), and other test scores (g = 0.423). Moderator analyses revealed that the effects vary depending on agent design features (e.g., gestures, voice, facial expression), content characteristics (e.g., subject domain, knowledge type), and learner attributes (e.g., education level, prior knowledge). This review further discusses the implications of agent embodiment, the \"uncanny valley\" in affective response, and challenges in long-term outcome assessments. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of how to optimise VDHPAs for immersive learning experiences and highlights directions for future interdisciplinary research in educational technology and digital arts.",

      "abstract": "In multimedia learning environments, pedagogical agents have emerged as an innovative tool to enhance digital instruction, yet optimising their design for maximal learning effectiveness remains underexplored.This study aimed to investigate how specific design elements of pedagogical agents, namely appearance and voice type, affect multimedia learning performance.A 2 (appearance: formal vs. informal)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (voice type: human vs. engine\u2010generated voice) between\u2010subjects design was employed, incorporating eye\u2010tracking technology. A total of 115 participants completed a multimedia learning module on chemical synaptic transmission. Learning outcomes were assessed using retention and transfer tests. Learner perceptions were measured across five indicators: social perception, perceived difficulty, lecture engagement, situational interest, and cognitive load.Pedagogical agents with a formal appearance positively influenced learning outcomes, increasing fixation duration and fixation count, while reducing perceived material difficulty and intrinsic load. Agents with human voices similarly enhanced learning outcomes, increasing fixation counts, social perception, lecture engagement, and situational interest, while reducing perception difficulty, intrinsic load and extraneous load. The combination of a human voice and formal appearance produced the greatest benefits in learning performance. Meanwhile, compared to the combination of informal appearance and engine\u2010generated voice, the formal appearance with a human voice indirectly affected learning outcomes by reducing perceived difficulty, intrinsic load and extraneous load. It also indirectly increased fixation count through enhanced social perception, lecture engagement and situational interest. These findings advance our understanding of the role of pedagogical agents in multimedia learning and offer valuable insights for designing effective instructional tools that maximise engagement and learning outcomes.",

A total of 200 university\u2002students from varying socio-economic backgrounds across Kisumu, Kisii and Homabay counties in Kenya were targeted as the population. A multi-stage stratified random sampling approach was used in order to obtain cases from\u2002a range of socio-economic statuses, geographical locations and school types. In addition to pre- and post-test data to measure learning outcomes, focus group data was collected to gain further qualitative insights\u2002into student preferences and experiences with the agents. Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and Social Presence Theory provided the theoretical framework for the study, with an emphasis on emotional involvement and the social aspects of\u2002learning. Didactic data from the pre- and post-tests were analyzed through paired-samples t-tests to compare the learning outcomes of the experimental and control groups, while measurement of engagement amount was analyzed with an independent t-test to determine the\u2002difference between the engagement of those students who interacted with more classical Agents against those who interacted with Technological (Abstract) Agents. Means and standard deviations were calculated\u2002using descriptive statistics. Focus group qualitative data were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using thematic analysis to extract common themes and insights regarding student preferences and\u2002agent efficacy. The findings demonstrate\u2002that students engaging with classical agents showed dramatically improved engagement levels (Mean: 4.3, SD = 0.5) and learning outcomes (25% improvement on post-test scores) compared with students using Technological (Abstract) Agents (Mean: 3.5, SD = 0.6; 15% improvement on post-test scores). Similarly, results from inferential statistics bolster these conclusions with a t-test identifying a significant difference in engagement scores (t(198) = 4.82, p < 0.05) and a paired-samples t-test indicating significant gains in learning outcomes associated with classical agents (t(99) = 8.75,\u2002p < 0.01). Focus group quantitative data indicated a strong overall preference\u2002for classical agents, with emotionally relatable feedback prevalent from qualitative analyses. 70% of\u2002urban students preferred classical agents, but rural students preferred both types of agents equally. The results of the study, along with their implications for learning environments in Kenya,\u2002suggest there is some promise of classical pedagogical agents enhancing engagement, and hence learning. Further studies are needed to fully understand their long-lasting\u2002effects and to better fit them to diverse educational settings to optimize their impact.",

In the past several years, research has examined how computer\u2010generated pedagogical agents can be designed to perform the four main gesture types and what this means for agent persona and learning outcomes. The research into agent gesturing has only explored gestures without other presentation strategies such as visual aids or verbal redundancy to properly explore the impact of gestures, and to avoid overly \u201crich\u201d displays of information.The objective of this study is to explore the use of static images and varying frequencies of gestures to assess whether two visual inputs increases the risk of the split\u2010attention effect, and to investigate the potential for visual redundancy when two visual inputs coincide with narration. Data on cognitive load, agent persona, and learning outcomes (recall and transfer) will be collected to measure participants' learning experience while acquiring procedural knowledge, specifically regarding the principles of lightning, in comparison to previous research.A mixed methods approach consisted of three gesture frequency conditions (enhanced, average, no) with 118 participants. Quantitative data were analysed using a random\u2010effect linear regression model; whereas qualitative data was collected through individual interviews that lasted 15\u201320\u2009min.The use of enhanced gesture frequency and images may significantly increase intrinsic cognitive load, but gestures and images do not cause extraneous cognitive load. The enhanced gesture condition significantly outperformed the no\u2010gesture condition. Interviews indicated that depending upon the gesture condition, students selectively attended to information that they perceived as offering them the greatest learning opportunity. Using two visual inputs does not cause split\u2010attention, nor does it provide evidence of a visual redundancy effect.",

Leveraging a design-based research approach, we develop, implement, and evaluate a novel learning environment enriched with four distinct chatbot roles: Instructor Bot, Peer Bot, Career Advising Bot, and Emotional Supporter Bot. These roles, designed around the tenets of Self-Determination Theory, cater to the three innate psychological needs of learners - competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Additionally, the system embraces an inquiry-based learning paradigm, encouraging students to ask questions, seek solutions, and explore their curiosities. We test this system in a higher education context over a period of one month with 200 participating students, comparing outcomes with conditions involving a human tutor and a single chatbot. Our research utilizes a mixed-methods approach, encompassing quantitative measures such as chat log sequence analysis, and qualitative methods including surveys and focus group interviews. By integrating cutting-edge Natural Language Processing techniques such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we offer an in-depth understanding of the system's impact on learner engagement, motivation, and inquiry-based learning. This study, through its rigorous design and innovative approach, provides significant insights into the potential of AI-empowered, multi-role chatbots in reshaping the landscape of computer science education and fostering an engaging, supportive, and motivating learning environment.",

A 2 x 2 between-subjects study was conducted with 84 participants to assess how adaptive role-switching and action-switching affect participants\u2019 learning outcomes and experiences. The results suggest that adaptive role-switching enhances participants\u2019 perception of the pedagogical agent\u2019s trustworthiness and expertise but may lead to inconsistent learning experiences. Adaptive action-switching increases participants\u2019 perceived social presence, expertise, and humanness.

The research focuses on students in a collaborative \u201cDatabase Systems and Design\u201d, comparing the effects of feedback from a human teacher (control group) to those of an Affective Pedagogical Tutor (APT) (experimental group). Emotional engagement was measured through key positive emotions such as motivation, curiosity, optimism, confidence, and satisfaction, as well as the reduction in negative emotions like boredom, anger, insecurity, and anxiety. Results suggest that APT feedback was associated with higher levels of emotional engagement compared to teacher feedback. Cognitive feedback from the APT was perceived as supporting learning outcomes by offering detailed, task-specific guidance, while affective feedback further supported emotional regulation and positive emotional states. Students interacting with the APT reported feeling more motivated, curious, and optimistic, which contributed to sustained participation and greater confidence in their work. At the same time, boredom and anger were notably reduced in the experimental group. These findings illustrate the potential of affective pedagogical agents to complement educational experiences by fostering positive emotional states and mitigating barriers to engagement. By integrating affective and cognitive feedback, pedagogical agents can create more emotionally supportive and engaging learning environments, particularly in collaborative and complex academic tasks.",

      "abstract": "Education plays a crucial role in the development of a nation, with teachers as agents of change. Mastery of teacher pedagogical competence is the key to designing effective learning. However, the low achievement of student learning outcomes and teacher competence in Indonesia is still a problem. This research uses the literature study method to explore the importance of mastering teachers' pedagogical competencies in improving the quality of education. The results show that teachers' mastery of pedagogical competence plays a significant role in successful learning. Factors such as lack of education and training, as well as limited teaching experience, affect teachers' abilities. Specific strategies need to be implemented in accordance with the Teacher Pedagogical Competency Standards to improve the quality of education. Ten pedagogical competencies, including mastery of student characters and the use of technology as a learning medium, guide the improvement of education quality. Through the literature study method, this research concludes that teachers' mastery of pedagogical competencies plays a central role in improving the quality of education in Indonesia. Special attention to teacher training and development is needed to ensure they can meet professional standards and bring about positive changes in education.",

An online experiment was conducted asking participants (N\u2009=\u2009183) to interact with a voice-based pedagogical agent in a between-subjects design: 2 (feedback: positive vs. negative) X 2 (agent: self-disclose vs. non-disclose).

Our findings showed that the agent\u2019s self-disclosure significantly increased students\u2019 perception of intimacy and cognitive trust toward the agent. A significant interaction effect was observed in intimacy, suggesting that the role of self-disclosure is especially pronounced when negative feedback is provided.

However, existing PA solutions are often hampered by pre-scripted dialogue, unnatural animations, uncanny visual realism, and high development costs. To address these gaps, we introduce VTutor, an open-source SDK leveraging lightweight WebGL, Unity, and JavaScript frameworks. VTutor receives text outputs from a large language model (LLM), converts them into audio via text-to-speech, and then renders a real-time, lip-synced pedagogical agent (PA) for immediate, large-scale deployment on web-based learning platforms. By providing on-demand, personalized feedback, VTutor strengthens students' motivation and deepens their engagement with instructional material. Using an anime-like aesthetic, VTutor alleviates the uncanny valley effect, allowing learners to engage with expressive yet comfortably stylized characters. Our evaluation with 50 participants revealed that VTutor significantly outperforms the existing talking-head approaches (e.g., SadTalker) on perceived synchronization accuracy, naturalness, emotional expressiveness, and overall preference. As an open-source project, VTutor welcomes community-driven contributions - from novel character designs to specialized showcases of pedagogical agent applications - that fuel ongoing innovation in AI-enhanced education. By providing an accessible, customizable, and learner-centered PA solution, VTutor aims to elevate human-AI interaction experience in education fields, ultimately broadening the impact of AI in learning contexts.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) fundamentally reshape learning and teaching models, shifting tutoring systems from supporting individual learning to facilitating collaborative learning (CL) like task-oriented group discussions. However, existing AI tutors struggle to guide CL, as they seldom model the interactions between AI tutors and students. Therefore, they cannot scaffold students to complete tasks collaboratively, which impairs learning outcomes and pedagogy adaptability. Additionally, existing AI tutors fail to make use of CL theories to generate instructive feedback, which leads to undesirable interactions such as over-instruction and limits students' autonomy. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based collaborative agent that innovatively leverages pedagogical strategies to sense discussion stages, detect learning issues, identify the timing of intervention, and generate instructive feedback. To develop the agent, we first design a prompting strategy based on a CL theory, that is, the Community of Inquiry, to cultivate the agent to understand the discussion status. Second, a multi-agent interaction framework is proposed to simulate the collaborative learning behavior between AI tutors and students. Meanwhile, a synthetic task-oriented group discussion dataset, namely CLTeach, is generated, which consists of 27k manually-verified multi-party dialogues with fine-grained annotations of instructive feedback and explanations. Lastly, we use CLTeach to fine-tune the LLM agent, ultimately enabling it to generate instructive feedback at the right time to support students in CL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance in feedback generation and has the potential to mimic human teachers effectively.",

Based on MAIC, an online learning platform with multi-agent, the research involved 305 university students and 19,365 lines of dialogue data. Pre- and post-test scores, self-reported motivation and technology acceptance were also collected. The study identified two engagement patterns: co-construction of knowledge and co-regulation. Lag sequential analysis revealed that students with lower prior knowledge relied more on co-construction of knowledge sequences, showing higher learning gains and post-course motivation. In contrast, students with higher prior knowledge engaged more in co-regulation behaviors but exhibited limited learning improvement. Technology acceptance increased across all groups. These findings suggest that multi-agent AI systems can adapt to students' varying needs, support differentiated engagement, and reduce performance gaps.

However, follow\u2010up studies and extensions of these findings remain scarce. To address this gap, we draw on multimedia learning and cognitive models to investigate the effects of using multiple AI voices as specialist virtual tutors for distinct programming algorithm subtopics on cognitive load and learning outcomes. A between\u2010subjects experimental design was employed with first\u2010year business undergraduates who had minimal programming knowledge. Participants engaged with a multimedia learning video, narrated either by a single AI voice or by three distinct AI voices, each assigned to a different subtopic. Cognitive load was measured via a survey, while learning outcomes were assessed using immediate and 2\u2010week delayed posttests covering retention, near\u2010transfer, and far\u2010transfer tasks. Results indicated that participants in the multiple AI voice condition reported significantly lower intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load compared to those in the single AI voice condition. Furthermore, the multiple AI voice group outperformed the single AI voice group in both immediate and delayed retention, as well as in immediate far\u2010transfer tasks and delayed near\u2010transfer. This study empirically extends prior research on the cognitive effects of using multiple AI voices as virtual tutors in multimedia learning environments. It offers preliminary evidence that using unique voices to distinguish subtopics can benefit cognitive load and learning outcomes, with theoretical and instructional design implications for leveraging AI text\u2010to\u2010speech engines to simulate multiple virtual tutors for distinct instructional topics.",

      "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence into educational settings has opened new pathways for second language acquisition, particularly through the use of conversational agents like chatbots. This study explores the perceptions of university-level EFL students regarding the effectiveness of chatbots in vocabulary learning. Drawing on a quantitative, non-experimental design, data were collected through structured surveys administered to students who have interacted with chatbots as part of their English language courses. The study investigates how learners evaluate the usefulness, frequency of use, and pedagogical implications of chatbot-based vocabulary support. Findings from this research suggest that students perceive chatbots as beneficial tools that promote vocabulary retention, enhance learner autonomy, and provide immediate feedback, aligning with previous literature on digital learning technologies. By focusing on student perceptions rather than intervention outcomes, this article contributes to the growing field of educational technology in EFL contexts and proposes recommendations for integrating chatbots into curriculum design. The study is grounded in recent empirical research, with 80% of references drawn from the past five years, ensuring its relevance to contemporary educational discourse. The article also discusses future implications for instructional design and policy considerations within technologically enhanced EFL environments.",

Relatedly, teacher education cycles, including collaborative pedagogical design work and reflective conversations on the pedagogical outcomes of design decisions, gained momentum in preservice language teacher education to explore the affordances of these decisions for teacher learning in talk-in-interaction across multiple pedagogical events. Using multimodal conversation analysis, this study describes how transnational groups of preservice language teachers, within the scope of a Virtual Exchange project, reflect on their experiences of teacher education activities such as collaborative task design, teacher educator feedback, and critically analyzing the implementation of their designs by actual L2 learners. A close examination of the video-mediated interactions of preservice teachers (PSTs) shows that small-group reflective conversations create opportunities to identify the interactional practices and teacher education activities that lead to claims of teacher learning. We present a collection of cases that include the PSTs\u2019 claims of teacher learning (e.g. I learned X) as a learning-relevant discursive construction and retrospectively trace the moments of claimed teacher learning across earlier teacher education events.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are unique pedagogical agents, in that (1) they can generate novel insights, and (2) they tend to be treated differently by humans, because they are opaquer and more intelligent than traditional technologies. Thus, it is not clear if and how people learn novel insights through AI feedback, and if the learning process and outcomes differ compared to when the source of insights and feedback is humans. Here, we seek to address this gap with four preregistered experiments (total n=1,766). They use a learning paradigm in which we manipulate the feedback source, feedback valence, and test instructions. The key finding is that people learn novel insights better when they receive negative feedback from AI than from humans. There is no difference in recall for positive feedback. This implies that AI as pedagogical agents are likely to outperform human feedback sources (peers or experts), or at least, be no worse. Our results further reveal that (1) people present typical human-human learning biases when receiving negative feedback from AI, namely mnemic neglect, and (2) ego bruising (as manifested in reduction in state self-esteem) and anger mediate such effects when receiving negative feedback from AI.",

Such often excludes or minimizes the active use of theory, being premised on problematic assumptions that can also potentially stagnate the field itself through circular reasoning. In this chapter, the author offers three considerations as a foundation for critical approaches to language teaching and learning. Firstly, the author acknowledges the performative and discursive capacity of language in shaping teaching and learning experiences; secondly, learners are positioned in this chapter as active agents in the learning process who have the potential to reinterpret or reject teaching and learning approaches; and finally, an argument is made for audience-specific teaching and learning practices using demographic data. To exemplify the application of these three considerations, Stuart Hall's Encoding-Decoding Theory serves as a key theoretical framework in this chapter, in conceptualizing critical approaches to teaching Generation Z learners.",

      "abstract": "The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In neoliberal times, accountability measures and high-stakes testing further contribute to differentiated outcomes for young people. The way that knowledge is conceptualised in tests regularly fails to recognise the embodied knowledge and abilities of many young people and instead students are positioned as passive receivers of knowledge. Students who are located in structural disadvantage continue to be least successful. This paper offers a critical counter-narrative to the didactic habit inherent in education through the mobilisation of creative and embodied practices as a transformational pedagogical approach. These pedagogies signal an epistemological and pedagogical shift toward mobilising bodies as agents of knowledge production and creativity as cultural capital. This paper reports on research that investigates primary school teachers and teaching artists using creative and body-based pedagogies, with a focus on enhancing student engagement in mathematics through strategies of \u2018encounter\u2019 (MacKenzie, Sarah. 2013. \u201cPoetic Praxis: Engaging Body, Mind, and Soul in the Social Foundations Classroom.\u201d Journal for Learning Through the Arts 9 (1): 1\u201327.). Findings highlight the cumulative affective responses and shifts in subjectivity for both students and teachers when working with the body\u2019s ability to move, feel, respond and imagine. In conclusion we argue for the potential of creative and body-based learning to build classroom communities and practices of inclusion.",

These innovations have the potential to strengthen clinical reasoning skills, increase student engagement, objectify assessment processes and support the retention of learning outcomes. However, effective and safe integration requires consideration of pedagogical alignment, ethical responsibilities, data security, algorithmic bias and human oversight. This study synthesises the extant evidence and proposes an integrated 'chatbot-centered integration model' for use in nursing education. The model synthesises Socratic questioning, gamified problem solving, simulation, virtual/augmented reality, and learning analytics within a unified framework, adopting a chatbot orchestrator role that facilitates pre-briefing, in-scenario counselling and debriefing stages. This synthesis is grounded in constructivism, situational learning, and pedagogical agents theory. The role of digital tools such as chatbots, simulations and artificial intelligence in nursing education is steadily increasing, as is their impact on students. These tools have numerous positive and negative impacts depending on the type and variety of use, and their effects are multidimensional.",

While many studies have discussed the chatbot's ability to motivate students' interest in learning, few have examined whether students' perception of learning affects the effectiveness of chatbots and the pedagogical approach taken by chatbots as conversational agents during the learning process. There is a need for new analysis to capture the effects of Chatbot-Assisted Learning (Chatbot-AL) and student-chatbot conversations. In an eight-week semester, 48 first-year undergraduate students participated in a chatbot-assisted learning environment integrated into an engineering course. Data were collected through questionnaires on students' learning motivation and discourse in chatbot conversations. Statistical non-parametric analysis and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) were used to explore the research questions. The results showed that students with high learning perception had better learning motivation using chatbot-AL than students with low learning perception. Additionally, most of the questions asked by students were aimed at receiving emotional support through casual conversation with the chatbot. Finally, the implications, limitations, and conclusions were discussed.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored in higher education, yet their effectiveness as teaching agents remains underexamined. In this paper, we present the development of GuideLM, a fine-tuned LLM designed for programming education. GuideLM has been integrated into the Debugging C Compiler (DCC), an educational C compiler that leverages LLMs to generate pedagogically sound error explanations. Previously, DCC relied on off-the-shelf OpenAI models, which, while accurate, often over-assisted students by directly providing solutions despite contrary prompting. To address this, we employed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of 528 student-question/teacher-answer pairs, creating two models: GuideLM and GuideLM-mini, fine-tuned on ChatGPT-4o and 4o-mini, respectively. We conducted an expert analysis of 400 responses per model, comparing their pedagogical effectiveness against base OpenAI models. Our evaluation, grounded in constructivism and cognitive load theory, assessed factors such as conceptual scaffolding, clarity, and Socratic guidance. Results indicate that GuideLM and GuideLM-mini improve pedagogical performance, with an 8% increase in Socratic guidance and a 58% improvement in economy of words compared to GPT-4o. However, this refinement comes at the cost of a slight reduction in general accuracy. While further work is needed, our findings suggest that fine-tuning LLMs with targeted datasets is a promising approach for developing models better suited to educational contexts.",

      "abstract": "The pedagogical agents for e-learning can immensely help in improving the quality of teaching, evaluating and learning the process through appropriate pedagogical agents. The pedagogical agents for adaptive e-learning systems are basically designed to provide a unique and personal experience to such students who come from diverse backgrounds having different styles of learning and with various educational needs. This study basically discusses the importance of pedagogical approach for the adaptive elearning systems. The selection of personalised (relevant) pedagogical agent can increase the effectiveness of adaptive e-learning, in the form of learning activities, delivered content, and communication. This will lead individuals to an adaptive pedagogical guided e-learning experience in which pedagogy will be the centerpiece, and in which the adaptive power will influence the pedagogy effectiveness. Thus, the main aim of this study is to discuss the importance of pedagogical agents in adaptive e-learning systems and to discuss different approaches of pedagogy including the constructivist approach, collaborative approach, inquiry-based approach, integrative approach, reflective approach, objectivist approach, and competency-b ased approach.",

PAs are software constructs (digital \u2018characters\u2019) that offer aid and support to the learner based on the learner's needs and recognized affective state. Primary studies that involve interaction of the PA with human learners in online educational contexts, are retrieved and screened according to a set of criteria. The subset of publications finally retained are analyzed to estimate the (possible) recent trend in PA-related research and to answer a number of research questions referring to the form, the role, the context and the effectiveness of the PA. A sustained interest rather than a trend has emerged from this analysis; moreover, the typical study uses an animated PA to teach a class of Computer Science undergraduate students; in 3 out of 4 studies, positive learning outcomes are reported and attributed to the presence of the PA. Results are discussed and further research directions are outlined.",

This study examines how different levels of learner control that a virtual teaching assistant (TA) offered impact students' self-efficacy, learning effectiveness, and satisfaction, given the moderating effects of student characteristics. A between-subjects study with 215 students across three learner control conditions revealed that the moderate control (i.e., Assisted Inquiry) led to higher perceived learning effectiveness than the high control. Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Openness were found to significantly influence students' learning. These findings underscore the need for adaptive PCA systems that tailor instructional support with scaffolding and balanced learning interventions while accounting for learners' personality traits to enhance student engagement and perceived learning effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Utilizing resources focused on artificial intelligence (A.I.) and its influence on education, this paper analyzes the impact of \u201canimated agents\u201d to aid students in learning and understanding a new language. We used these articles to understand the effect that A.I. has on the anxiety levels of students and how these learners respond to differing motivational agents. Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA) is a term used to describe the stress exhibited by learners of a new language, specifically when being negatively evaluated by others or when perceiving an inability in themselves. FLA is a major barrier when it comes to the overall growth of a student and his/her proficiency in the new language, as it increases stress and decreases motivation to learn by making students think that they are not good enough. Because this has led to a notable decline in learners\u2019 performance in that subject, pedagogical methods have been developed and examined to provide emotional support. With a group of 56 students and an e-learning system, researchers utilized either motivational or explanatory feedback through the use of text, voice, or animated agents (characters that can engage students and present information), and measured anxiety levels across the different combinations. While the motivational support of an agent was most sufficient, gender played a big role in the efficacy of different pedagogical methods; therefore, incorporating the gender of the learner into artificial intelligence systems and animated agents in the future would personalize feedback in forms that males and females can better take in and implement. To provide more equity in education, these results can be applied to other anxiety barriers that actively prevent students from developing the skills essential for their learning. With the proper assistance from A.I., FLA can become a thing of the past, and language learners can no longer suffer from the stress of learning something entirely new.",

Additionally, we argue that our future effectiveness in leading systemic change toward health justice requires our public health training institutions to deliver course content that addresses racism and other systemic forms of oppression, largely responsible for reproducing health inequities. We also reflect upon how our efforts to find spaces in which to critically engage with content related to social and structural determinants of health transformed into a collaborative learning opportunity that has served to strengthen our skills as public health researchers, advocates, and future educators. We conclude by calling upon our schools of public health to take the lead in preparing the public health workforce of tomorrow for the challenges of addressing systemic causes of health inequities. Our goal is to share our experiences so that graduate students across public health training institutions may look to this piece as a concrete example of how we can shape our schools of public health to meet our needs.",

In addition, we attempted to reveal what instructional strategies can be used in tutoring\u2010style videos to enhance students' engagement and achievement.The study took place in an undergraduate introductory biology class offered at a university located in the Midwest of the United States. The same instructor taught two sections of this course which lasted for 15\u2009weeks during a Spring semester. The two sections were randomly assigned to an experimental group in which participants watched tutoring\u2010style videos and a control group with participants watching traditional videos. The experiment was administered in a module lasting two and a half weeks focused on microbiology. Surveys and tests were conducted to determine whether the tutoring\u2010style videos had a positive impact on student engagement and achievement. In addition, a video content analysis was carried out to elicit insights on how to design effective tutoring\u2010style videos.For students' emotional engagement and perceived usefulness, no significant difference was found between the two groups, even though the descriptive statistics indicated slightly higher scores from the experimental group than the control group on both subscales. In terms of achievement, the participants reported significantly more learned concepts from watching rich\u2010interactions in the tutoring\u2010style videos than the participants in the control group; and they also reported a significantly smaller number of learned concepts from watching one\u2010interactions in the videos than the control group participants. We also found that instruction in the tutoring\u2010style videos used effective strategies for facilitating students' participation and cognitive processing.Our findings indicate that tutoring\u2010style videos can be effective learning materials by allowing students to engage in interactions between instructors and agents in the videos. The more instructional strategies used to facilitate the interactions between the instructor and the agents, the higher engagement can be expected from viewers. Our study would inform the design and development of effective tutoring\u2010style videos.",

      "abstract": "Technological advancements are transforming education systems, adding new dimensions to learning processes. Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have significant potential to provide personalized learning experiences, support teachers, and enhance educational efficiency. This article explores the theoretical framework of AI in education, discussing concepts such as Vygotsky\u2019s Sociocultural Theory, Piaget\u2019s Cognitive Development Theory, and the Dual Process Theory. AI-powered adaptive learning systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based chatbots, and automated assessment mechanisms offer personalized learning paths for students, enhancing the learning experience. However, the implementation of AI in education also raises ethical concerns and pedagogical challenges. Issues such as student data privacy, algorithmic bias, and teachers' adoption of AI tools are critical factors determining the effectiveness of these technologies. The paper provides a comprehensive discussion on the advantages, challenges, and future perspectives of AI-assisted education systems. In conclusion, to ensure the effective and ethical integration of AI in education, investments should be made in teacher training, data security policies must be strengthened, and student-centered AI systems should be continuously developed.",

Within the context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), this model transforms students from passive consumers of information into active agents of change. The study demonstrates that leveraging IoT sensors enables students to tackle pressing and complex sustainability challenges by engaging them in a comprehensive problem-solving cycle\u2014from collecting real-world data to developing innovative solutions. By analysing the existing scientific literature, the approach is shown to significantly improve critical thinking skills, systems thinking, creativity, and teamwork. The study also proposes a new conceptual framework (hypothesis), the EcoHabits model, whose effectiveness remains to be empirically validated. This model demonstrates IoT\u2019s potential to enhance sustainability competencies, improve health literacy, and promote individual and collective behaviour change. Despite its significant pedagogical benefits, the article identifies key implementation challenges, including the need for adequate teacher training and community collaboration. In conclusion, this innovative framework offers a promising solution for preparing future generations to address global issues and become active, responsible citizens of the 21st century.",

Serious games have demonstrated their effectiveness in several domains, while there is contradictory data on their efficiency in modifying behavior and their possible disadvantages. Serious games are games that are specifically created to fulfill a primary goal other than entertainment. The objective of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a serious game designed for the self-assessment of students concerning their knowledge of web technologies on students with an equivalent online quiz that uses the same collection of questions. The primary hypotheses we stated were that those utilizing the serious game would experience better results in terms of engagement, subjective experience, and learning compared to those using the online quiz. To examine these research questions, the IMI questionnaire, the total number of completed questions, and post-test grades were utilized to compare the two groups, which consisted of 34 undergraduate students. Our findings indicate that the serious game users did not have a better experience or better learning outcomes, but that they engaged more, answering significantly more questions. Future steps include finding more participants and extending the experimental period.",

Developed through a three-phase methodology, offline preparation, real-time deployment, and evaluation, the system employs both retrieval-based and generative AI models, with specialized agents managing tasks such as translation, example retrieval, user translation review, and learning feedback. The chatbot was developed using a hybrid architecture incorporating fine-tuned Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, sentence embedding techniques, and similarity evaluation metrics. A user study involving 40 undergraduate students and 4 faculty members evaluated the system across usability, effectiveness, and pedagogical value. Results show that the multi-agent chatbot significantly enhanced learner engagement, provided accurate and contextually appropriate language support, and was positively received by both students and instructors. These findings demonstrate the value of multi-agent design in language learning applications and highlight the potential of AI-driven chatbots as intelligent educational assistants.",

The objective was, in general, to know the effectiveness of the application of a playful pedagogical resource with riddles and mathematical challenges for the construction of an effective learning of the contents of Algebra, by students of the 7th year of Elementary School, from a school in the city of Buti\u00e1/RS. The research methodology was carried out by the qualitative method, taking into account, initially, three important aspects: the observations of the mediator teacher and the students involved in the experiment; their feedback in relation to the effectiveness of the experiment; and the comparison, from the teacher's point of view, in relation to previous years' learning with traditional methods. It was found that the use of the playful resource in question serves to promote meaningful and pleasurable learning, encouraging students to become active agents in the search for their own knowledge through raising hypotheses, solving problem situations, logical challenges and debates/exchanges between 1 Mestranda em Doc\u00eancia para Ci\u00eancias, Tecnologias, Engenharias e Matem\u00e1tica \u2013 Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Sul (UERGS).

Support provided to students is usually presented through pedagogical agents capable of expressing emotions through facial expressions, gestures and synthesized speech. Dialogue content is important as it contains information that will help the student learn new information, further understand concepts or correct misconceptions. Although these interventions are based on existing theories, there are still cases when feedback may not fit students as they are very diverse and can be in very different contexts. One very important aspect to consider is how students appraise the feedback given by an ITS. By knowing the student\u2019s appraisal of feedback, feedback that is effective and should be retained or replaced can be identified. This research investigates student emotions represented by frustration and excitement values resulting from appraisal of feedback as recognized by an EEG-based device. Frustration and excitement values resulting from feedback appraisal are correlated with feedback from the POOLEIII ITS to create predictive models of these relations. The use of these models will allow future ITS to identify the emotions that result from student appraisal of feedback before it is given, and allow it to perform adjustments on the feedback when necessary. \n \n \n",

The following research questions will be answered: Q1) Do you know this educational technology? Q2) If so, are teachers used to integrate this type of technology in the classroom? and, P3) If teachers could design the agent, what characteristics do they consider to be the most appropriate? How should the agent react to different situations?

      "abstract": "Proverbs can shed light on the behaviour of economic agents in the ways that mainstream economics does not. In this paper, I focus on proverbs from all over the world which are about wealth. Whilst economics textbooks ascribe only a positive role to money (money expands the set of goods that can be purchased), proverbs recognize that money, or, to be more accurate, the way in which we relate to money, can also entail negative aspects, such as inhibiting genuine social relationships. I argue that, as responsible economics educators, we have a duty towards our students to pass to them this time-honoured knowledge. The paper offers evidence of the effectiveness of this approach in class using both quantitative and interview data. It uses a variety of pedagogical approaches as a way to theoretically underpin and evaluate the use of proverbs in the classroom. It also makes available to economics tutors a database with more than 200 proverbs that are related to economic issues.",

To achieve the goal, we used four TPACK activities; Explore-Engage-Reflection-Transformation. The study employed mixed methods with a TPACK questionnaire and open questions. Increased self-efficacy perceptions of TPACK was evaluated using a one-group pre-post-post research design. The sample was 30 pre-service teachers (5 male; 25 female) at a public university in Indonesia. Paired t-test was used to examine the significant difference between pretest and posttest scores and Cohen\u2019s d was calculated to check the strength of the effect size. As a result, the paired t-test showed that the posttest scores were significantly higher than the pretest scores for all TPACK dimensions with large effect sizes. In addition, qualitative data from students\u2019 reflections were analyzed. It found that pre-service teachers understand the role of technology integration in the TPACK framework for creating meaningful learning experiences. Participants reflected on the role as assessment for, and as learning. Professional learning from the New Zealand education system was introduced within a holistic framework to stimulate students to be creative future-directed teachers and agents of change. This indicates that the present training program increased the pre-service teachers\u2019 perceptions of TPACK at the end of the training. We suggest that TPACK training programs that facilitate how pre-service teachers integrate technology, content, and pedagogy to create effective technology-enriched learning environments in their subjects should be included in teacher education programs.",

The relevance of the study is conditioned by the increasing requirements to the professional training of future teachers, who should not only possess subject knowledge, but also have developed meta-subject competences for the effective organisation of the educational process in accordance with modern educational standards. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the influence of active teaching methods on the development of meta-subject competences of students at a teacher training university. The article describes the methodology of teaching the workshop \u2018Pedagogical diagnostics of meta-educational results\u2019, implemented within the framework of the academic discipline \u2018Pedagogy\u2019. The methodological basis of the study is the competence approach developed in the works of I. A. Zimnya and A. V. Khutorsky, in the framework of which the didactic conditions for the formation of metacognition and metacognition as components of students\u2019 metacompetences are identified and described. Special attention is paid to the design of the content, structure and forms of learning activities at the workshop taking into account the data of the input diagnostics of the level of students\u2019 metacompetences formation. The system of specially developed meta-subject tasks was used to assess the competences formation. The students\u2019 difficulties revealed during their fulfilment determined the content and choice of forms of learning activities during the experiment. The analysis of the workshop performance was based on the comparison of data obtained before and after its implementation (using the test-retest method), which allowed us to objectively assess the dynamics of metacognitive competences development. The results of the study demonstrate a statistically significant improvement of indicators in the experimental group compared to the control group. Students who participated in the experimental work demonstrated a higher level of meta-subject competences, including the skills of independent search and critical analysis of information, the ability to reflect on their own learning activities, the ability to establish interdisciplinary links and apply knowledge in new situations. The practical significance of the study lies in the possibility of using its results to improve the educational programmes of pedagogical universities. The materials of the study can become the basis for the development of new programmes and methods that contribute to the further development of students\u2019 meta-subject competencies in the system of higher pedagogical education, which will ultimately contribute to improving the quality of training of future teachers.",

The research was conducted over 2024\u20132025 in three leading military lyceums in Ukraine, involving 444 tenth-grade students divided into experimental and control groups.\n\nFive criteria were defined to assess ICC formation: value-motivational, intellectual, informational-technological, behavioral-activity-based, and subject-based. Levels of competence were measured using specifically developed diagnostic tools, including questionnaires, tests, and practical skill assessments.\n\nThe findings demonstrated a significant positive dynamic in ICC formation among the experimental group participants. Statistically significant increases in the number of cadets achieving sufficient and high levels of ICC were recorded across all criteria compared to the control group. Statistical analysis using Student's t-test confirmed that observed differences were not random, thereby validating the effectiveness of the author's proposed model and methodology. Consequently, the research outcomes strongly support the hypothesis regarding the efficacy of the implemented pedagogical approaches for fostering ICC among lyceum students.",

It is shown that the most promising ways to increase the effectiveness of physical education of high school students are the sports orientation of the educational process, the renewal of traditional and the involvement of non-traditional means, methods and forms that comprehensively combine health and applied orientation, the formation of didactic content of the content of lessons taking into account the individual capabilities of those who are engaged, which allows achieving high variability and motor density, increasing the activity of schoolchildren. It is established that sports games include a wide arsenal of natural movements and actions, which allows them to be used in the motor training of high school students. The use of simulators enhances the effectiveness of physical exercises. From the present position, experience has been accumulated in creating technical devices and simulators for teaching sports games, however, the pedagogical aspect, which includes the development and use of technical means during sports games by high school students of different levels of motor fitness, remains poorly studied. The organizational and pedagogical conditions for using simulator equipment in physical education lessons for high school students during the study of sports games have been determined, namely: compliance with hygiene requirements and safety of places of study; availability of simulator equipment for the development of basic motor skills in the process of playing sports games; use of practical experience in implementing simulators in the educational process of physical education; increasing the motivation of high school students for systematic motor activity in various forms of playing sports games; implementation of an individual approach by taking into account the level of motor fitness of schoolchildren; creation of a system of objective control over the development of motor skills using simulator equipment in the process of playing sports games.",

However, research has found that question asking is infrequent in the classroom and children's questions are often superficial, lacking deep reasoning. In this work, we developed a pedagogical agent that encourages children to ask divergent-thinking questions, a more complex form of questions that is associated with curiosity. We conducted a study with 95 fifth grade students, who interacted with an agent that encourages either convergent-thinking or divergent-thinking questions. Results showed that both interventions increased the number of divergent-thinking questions and the fluency of question asking, while they did not significantly alter children's perception of curiosity despite their high intrinsic motivation scores. In addition, children's curiosity trait has a mediating effect on question asking under the divergent-thinking agent, suggesting that question-asking interventions must be personalized to each student based on their tendency to be curious.",

The chatbot workshop provides non-STEM students with an opportunity to acquire basic skills to build a chatbot prototype using the \u2018Dialogflow\u2019 program. The workshop and the experiential learning activity are designed to impart conversation and user-centric design know how and know why to students. A key didactical aspect which informs the design and flow of the chatbot workshop is that novice learners with no or very little knowledge about A.I. recognize and create the important linkage between knowledge inputs and outputs of conversational agents powered by natural language processing (NLP) so that user queries can be effectively addressed. According to the study results, 90.7% of all surveyed students (n\u2009=\u200943) were satisfied with the experiential learning chatbot workshop; 81.4% of the respondents felt engaged while 81.3% of the participants reported moderate to high levels of competencies (81.3%) as result of the hands-on workshop. Almost all students surveyed (97.7%) felt that the experiential chatbot workshop had met the expected learning outcomes. Besides presenting empirical data that underscore the pedagogical usefulness of conducting an experiential Chatbot workshop in basic A.I. classes with special reference to NLP, we are trying to corroborate a conceptual model developed from learning theories and technology mediated learning (TML) models aimed at measuring the effects of a chatbot practicum on students\u2019 engagement and motivation as potential drivers of successfully acquiring basic NLP skills and learner satisfaction. The paper provides useful practical information for instructors interested in deploying a practical chatbot workshop as effective TML tool in a tertiary educational context aimed at making learners \u2018future-ready\u2019.",

This enables learners to go along many learning routes with the shared objective of information and skill development. In such systems, adaptivity and intelligence play distinct roles, with adaptivity being a more data-driven decision-making approach and intelligence being the emulation of human traits in a learning setting. Pedagogical agents, as defined in the field of artificial intelligence, are virtual characters with anthropomorphic features that are introduced for educational reasons.

      "abstract": "The main purpose of pedagogical support is to achieve the development of students. Since each student has his / her own individual characteristics, these features should be taken into account in the provision of pedagogical support. Taking into account individual characteristics increases the effectiveness of teacher assistance and pedagogical support. Therefore, the individual skills, abilities and other characteristics of students should be studied and taken into account by the teacher. The article highlights these issues, analyzes the existing shortcomings and comments on the methodology of work in this direction. The learning process should be focused on the education of children, and buyoramne materials should be used for their development. At the same time, they need pedagogical support for what, where, when and in what way to give them. In our opinion, in-depth study of students is important for pedagogical support to be effective and not to remain just a help for the sake of break. Practice shows that the child is able to better master and perceive the pedagogical support, the pedagogical influence that is made on him/her so that all the effects were made taking into account his/her individual characteristics. The influence can correspond his /her desires, interests and inclinations, as well as penetrate his/her inner world. It is obvious that this can happen only if the teacher is well aware of the individual characteristics of children, all the psychological features of their personality, temperament, character, memory features, level of skills and abilities, potential. In this regard, one of the main aspects to be considered during pedagogical support is to achieve the development of individuality in children, including students. Pedagogical support is more effective and result-oriented if it is not one-sided, but covers many areas. The student's mental and physical health, various skills and abilities, opportunities for self-determination and self-realization must be the object of pedagogical support, and the teacher must be able to provide pedagogical support for their development.",

Systematic volleyball lessons contribute to the formation of a healthy lifestyle, have a versatile effect on the body of those involved and contributing to the development of basic physical qualities - speed, agility, endurance, coordination and strength. Learning is carried out through the perception and processing of relevant information, and for the qualitative study of technology, accurate information and its understandable explanation are required. The process of mastering the techniques of playing volleyball is subject to the laws of the formation of motor skills, therefore, in the formation of a motor skill, phases are distinguished that go in a certain order one after another, respectively, they should be considered from the physiological, psychological and methodological points of view. Purpose: to consider methods of increasing the effectiveness of teaching volleyball students of the ZVO in the process of physical education. Material and methods of research: analysis of scientific and methodological literature, generalization. Results: The article deals with the initial stage of teaching the technique of playing volleyball in higher educational institutions. At each training session, students not only study a new motor action, but also consolidate the previously studied material, improve the acquired motor skills. In addition to studying technical and tactical actions and improving skills, attention is paid to physical training, both general and special. This health- improving orientation can be traced in every training session and is combined with the formation of motor skills and the training of technical and tactical actions in volleyball.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that students learn better from an online lesson when a gesturing pedagogical agent is added (Mayer & DaPra, 2012; Wang, Li, Mayer, & Liu, 2018). The goal of this study is to pinpoint which aspect of a gesturing pedagogical agent causes an improvement in learning from an online lesson. College students learned about neural transmission in an online multimedia lesson that included a pedagogical agent who displayed specific pointing gestures (i.e., pointing to the specific component in the diagram being mentioned in the narration), general pointing gestures (i.e., pointing in the general direction of the diagram), nonpointing gestures (moving hands as beats, moving an arm up or down, or crossing two hands), or no gestures. An analysis of students\u2019 eye movements during learning showed that students in the specific-pointing group paid more attention to task-related elements than did students in the other groups (as indicated by fixation time and fixation count on the target area of interest). Students in the specific-pointing group also performed better than the other groups on retention and transfer tests administered immediately after the lesson and after a 1-week delay. The results show that an active ingredient in effective pedagogical agents is the use of specific pointing gestures. This work helps clarify the embodiment principle and image principle by isolating specific pointing (or deictic gestures) as a key feature that makes gesturing effective in multimedia lessons.

      "abstract": "Creating conditions that ensure the identification of gifted children with the subsequent development and realization of their potential is one of the priorities in modern educational conditions. The difficulty of solving these problems is largely due to the lack of uniform methods for identifying giftedness, as well as difficulties in organizing the educational process for such children. The pedagogical community agrees that the peculiarities of the intellectual development of talented students make it necessary to reach a qualitatively different level of teaching, which involves not just the assimilation of information, but the manifestation of the intellectual initiative of students. The emphasis in the professional activity of a teacher when working with such students shifts: here it is necessary not to impart knowledge, but to organize educational activities in a new way. We are talking about the transition from the organization of the traditional educational process to the design of a new educational environment for such a student, in which it will be possible to build an individual educational trajectory. The purpose of such teaching is to provide favorable conditions for the development and improvement of the types of gifts inherent in these students. The paper describes the experience of introducing a number of pedagogical technologies into the educational process, which are based on the basic principles and strategies for teaching gifted children. This was aimed at organizing the educational activities of students with signs of giftedness, taking into account their individual characteristics and made it possible to provide a personal pace of learning and, in part, an individual trajectory for students with signs of academic (mathematical) giftedness. A comparative analysis of the training results of two focus groups showed the effectiveness of using such technologies.",

      "abstract": "The field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) focuses on the intersection of technology, education, and psychology, placing a strong emphasis on supporting learners' needs with compassion and understanding. The growing prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of scalable solutions within educational settings, including generating different types of feedback in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, the approach to utilizing these models often involves directly formulating prompts to solicit specific information, lacking a solid theoretical foundation for prompt construction and empirical assessments of their impact on learning. This work advocates careful and caring AIED research by going through previous research on feedback generation in ITS, with emphasis on the theoretical frameworks they utilized and the efficacy of the corresponding design in empirical evaluations, and then suggesting opportunities to apply these evidence-based principles to the design, experiment, and evaluation phases of LLM-based feedback generation. The main contributions of this paper include: an avocation of applying more cautious, theoretically grounded methods in feedback generation in the era of generative AI; and practical suggestions on theory and evidence-based feedback design for LLM-powered ITS.",

      "abstract": "Large class sizes challenge personalized learning in schools, prompting the use of educational technologies such as intelligent tutoring systems. To address this, we present an AI-driven personalization system, called ZPDES, based on the Learning Progress Hypothesis - modeling curiosity-driven learning - and multi-armed bandit techniques. It sequences exercises that maximize learning progress for each student. While previous studies demonstrated its efficacy in enhancing learning compared to hand-made curricula, its impact on student motivation remained unexplored. Furthermore, ZPDES previously lacked features allowing student choice, a limitation in agency that conflicts with its foundation on models of curiosity-driven learning. This study investigates how integrating choice, as a gamification element unrelated to exercise difficulty, affects both learning outcomes and motivation. We conducted an extensive field study (265 7-8 years old children, RCT design), comparing ZPDES with and without choice against a hand-designed curriculum. Results show that ZPDES improves both learning performance and the learning experience. Moreover adding choice to ZPDES enhances intrinsic motivation and further strengthens its learning benefits. In contrast, incorporating choice into a fixed, linear curriculum negatively impacts learning outcomes. These findings highlight that the intrinsic motivation elicited by choice (gamification) is beneficial only when paired with an adaptive personalized learning system. This insight is critical as gamified features become increasingly prevalent in educational technologies.",

The landing simulator is enabled with automation assistance that can turn on or off; when on, the automation assistance augments the learner\u2019s input to mimic an expert\u2019s landing trajectory. The authors design an algorithm to calibrate learners\u2019 self-confidence to their performance and compare it against learners\u2019 who do not receive any assistance.

In two consecutive semesters, we conducted two classroom experiments: Exp. 1 used a classic artificial intelligence approach to classify students into different metacognitive groups and provide static interventions based on their classified groups. In Exp. 2, we leveraged Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to provide adaptive interventions that consider the dynamic changes in the student's metacognitive levels. In both experiments, students received these interventions that taught how and when to use a backward-chaining (BC) strategy on a logic tutor that supports a default forward-chaining strategy. Six weeks later, we trained students on a probability tutor that only supports BC without interventions. Our results show that adaptive DRL-based interventions closed the metacognitive skills gap between students. In contrast, static classifier-based interventions only benefited a subset of students who knew how to use BC in advance. Additionally, our DRL agent prepared the experimental students for future learning by significantly surpassing their control peers on both ITSs.",

Specifically, we designed an Intelligent Tutoring System for Chinese character learning, which is grounded in a Multimodal Large Language Model with a feedback mechanism based on feedback literacy principles. We then conducted a Chinese teaching experiment to validate the system's effectiveness. Our findings indicate that students using ITS receive more timely corrective feedback and perform better in writing Chinese characters than in the traditional teaching method.

Intelligent Tutoring Systems were developed to enrich the teaching-learning process. Materials and Methods In the present work, the interface is designed and developed utilizing the potential of Artificial Intelligence to meet their individual needs. Designing an online learning platform for a learners with learning difficulties requires consideration of their learning problems and preferences. The interface was developed focusing on all the requirements of the LD learners. The objective of the present study is to monitor the learning experience in the form of induced emotions and cognitive load of the learners to determine the impact of learning. Results 83 learners were observed during various stage of learning. The results obtained through the Support Vector machine (SVM) classification technique showed the positive attitude towards intelligent tutoring. The analysis revealed that a total of 0.23% of learners were positively induced. Their learning experience was positive and effective. The cognition load on learners was minimum with single-mode instruction and least disturbed. Conclusions The system was improved based on preference feedback on design features. This helps in improving content design and creating device independent and responsive visual design. The fatigue effect analysis on cognitive load implied that multiple modes of instruction increased drowsiness. Single mode of instruction have a positive impact on the learning process and it reduces the cognitive load of the learners. Implications for Rehabilitation The user interface designed and developed for learners with Dyslexia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia has learning disabled-friendly features. These can be used to create a device-independent and responsive design. Learning experience is monitored along with the impact on cognitive load of the learners. The research helps in understanding the stimulation and response of learners with learning disability for different learning conditions. Most existing learning systems are limited to non-learning-disabled learners. The ITS developed during research presents a Universal learning design helpful for all learners with and without learning disability.",

      "abstract": "\nPurpose\nIntelligent tutoring systems (ITS) are a supplemental educational tool that offers great benefits to students and teachers. The systems are designed to focus on an individual\u2019s characteristics, needs and preferences in an effort to improve student outcomes. Despite the potential benefits of such systems, little work has been done to investigate the impact of ITS on users. To provide a more nuanced understanding of the effectiveness of ITS, the purpose of this paper is to explore the role of several ITS parameters (i.e. knowledge, system, service quality and task\u2013technology fit (TTF)) in motivating, satisfying and helping students to improve their learning performance.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nData were obtained from students who used ITS, and a structural equation modeling was deployed to analyze the data.\n\n\nFindings\nData analysis revealed that the quality of knowledge, system and service directly impacted satisfaction and improved TTF for ITS. It was found that TTF and student satisfaction with ITS did not generate higher learning performance. However, student satisfaction with ITS did improve learning motivation and resulted in superior learning performance. Data suggest this is due to students receiving constant and constructive feedback while simultaneously collaborating with their peers and teachers.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study verifies that there was a need to assess the benefits of ITS. Based on the study\u2019s findings, theoretical and practical implications are proposed.\n",

However, students usually solve math tasks using paper and pen. Therefore, the gap between the manner the students work and the requirements imposed by these typing-based systems expose students to an extraneous cognitive load, impairing their learning. Our study investigates the impact of the data input method on students\u2019 learning and \ufb02uency in solving equations using step-based math ITSs. More speci\ufb01cally, we have considered the standard typing and handwriting input methods. We hypothesized that the students would be more \ufb02uent using their handwriting with online recognition to solve math equations than using the typing input method. This \ufb02uency indicates a reduction in cognitive load, freeing working memory for logical reasoning instead of interface preconditions, leading to improved learning. We have conducted an experiment with 55 seventh-grade students from a private school to validate the hypothesis, randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Each group used one of the input methods on two di\ufb00erent devices (desktop computers and tablets). Although students using handwriting solved more equations and were faster than students who typed their equations, we could not \ufb01nd statistically signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences in the learning between students that used typing or handwriting. Additionally, we have found that the input method used in a not ideal device (e.g., handwriting with a computer\u2019s mouse instead of using a touch screen device) can negatively a\ufb00ect the students\u2019",

The findings suggest that while ITSs can significantly improve learning attitudes and test scores, their effects on knowledge acquisition, learner motivation, performance, and problem-solving skills are less conclusive. The impact of ITSs on educational outcomes also varies across different countries and educational levels, with no significant relationship observed between educational levels and ITS effectiveness. The use of specific ITS designs, such as game-integrated ITSs and ITSs with worked examples, appears to have a more positive impact on educational outcomes.

Most developed ITSs typically focus on the normal cognitive factors such as the students\u2019 prior success and failure scores without paying appropriate consideration to the sensitive cognitive factors that have a great impact on the student performance prediction such as the integration of the human current skills and given items skills, particularly when the learning items require multiple skills, which thus reduce student\u2019s learning efficiency due to an incomplete representation of the student\u2019s knowledge. This paper presents a modified student modeling approach, called modified Performance Factor Analysis (ModPFA), based on a previously developed model called Performance Factor Analyses (PFA).

      "abstract": "\nPurpose\nIn intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), learners were often granted limited authority and are forced to obey the decision of the system which might not satisfy their needs. Failure to grant learners sufficient autonomy could yield unexpected effects that hinder learning, including undermining learners\u2019 motivation, priming learners\u2019 aversion to the algorithm. On the contrary, granting learners overwhelming autonomy could also be harmful as the absence of learning support would also have a negative impact on learning. As such, this study aims to design and implement an intelligent tutoring system that offers learners proper autonomy.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe main learning activity in the system is doing exercises, and by finishing exercises learners could earn virtual coins. Based on item response theory, exercises are administered to learners with proper difficulty. Based on a recommended difficulty parameter predicted by the system, learners could manually modify the difficulty of the exercises, they could earn more credits by finishing more challenging exercises. Meanwhile, a pedagogical agent is embedded. Learners could customize the agent\u2019s personality jointly with the system to create the learning context they prefer.\n\n\nFindings\nA intelligent tutoring system with proper learner autonomy (LA) is designed and implemented.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nFew previous researches have noticed the potentially important role that LA plays in ITS. Learning might be facilitated using such a design.\n",

      "abstract": "Background Shortage of human resources, increasing educational costs, and the need to keep social distances in response to the COVID-19 worldwide outbreak have prompted the necessity of clinical training methods designed for distance learning. Virtual patient simulators (VPSs) may partially meet these needs. Natural language processing (NLP) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may further enhance the educational impact of these simulators. Objective The goal of this study was to develop a VPS for clinical diagnostic reasoning that integrates interaction in natural language and an ITS. We also aimed to provide preliminary results of a short-term learning test administered on undergraduate students after use of the simulator. Methods We trained a Siamese long short-term memory network for anamnesis and NLP algorithms combined with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology for diagnostic hypothesis generation. The ITS was structured on the concepts of knowledge, assessment, and learner models. To assess short-term learning changes, 15 undergraduate medical students underwent two identical tests, composed of multiple-choice questions, before and after performing a simulation by the virtual simulator. The test was made up of 22 questions; 11 of these were core questions that were specifically designed to evaluate clinical knowledge related to the simulated case. Results We developed a VPS called Hepius that allows students to gather clinical information from the patient\u2019s medical history, physical exam, and investigations and allows them to formulate a differential diagnosis by using natural language. Hepius is also an ITS that provides real-time step-by-step feedback to the student and suggests specific topics the student has to review to fill in potential knowledge gaps. Results from the short-term learning test showed an increase in both mean test score (P<.001) and mean score for core questions (P<.001) when comparing presimulation and postsimulation performance. Conclusions By combining ITS and NLP technologies, Hepius may provide medical undergraduate students with a learning tool for training them in diagnostic reasoning. This may be particularly useful in a setting where students have restricted access to clinical wards, as is happening during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries worldwide.",

The work depicts a study developed in Mexico to measure the impact on the learning and motivation of students using two different learning systems: an intelligent tutoring system with augmented reality (ARGeoITS) and a system with only augmented reality (ARGeo). To study the effect of this type of technology (ARGeoITS, ARGeo) and time of assessment (pre-, post-) on learning gains and motivation, we applied a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design to 106 middle school students. Both pretest and post-test questionnaires were applied to each group to determine the students\u2019 learning gains, as was an IMMS motivational survey to evaluate the students\u2019 motivation. The results show that: (1) students who used the intelligent tutoring system ARGeoITS scored higher in learning gain (7.47) compared with those who used ARGeo (6.83); and (2) both the ARGeoITS and ARGeo learning tools have a positive impact on students\u2019 motivation. The research findings imply that intelligent tutoring systems that integrate augmented reality can be exploited as an effective learning environment to help middle\u2013high school students learn difficult topics such as geometry.",

      "abstract": "The swelling use of computerized learning, accompanied by the rapid growth of information technology has become a surge of interest in the research community. Consequently, several technologies have been developed to maintain and promote computerized learning. In this study, we provided an in-depth analysis of two of the prominent computerized learning systems i.e., Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) and Affective Tutoring System (ATS). An ITS is one of the training software systems, which use intelligent technologies to provide personalized learning content to students based on their learning needs with the aim of enhancing the individualized learning experience. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that the affect or emotional states of a student have an impact on the overall performance of his/her learning, which introduces a new trend of ITS development termed as ATS, which is the extended research of the previous one. Although there have been several studies on these tutoring systems, however, none of them has comprehensively analyzed both systems, particularly the transition from ITS to ATS. Therefore, this study examines these two tutoring systems more inclusively with regards to their architectures, models, and techniques and approaches used by taking into consideration the related researches conducted between 2014 to 2019. A crucial finding from the study is that ATS can be a promising tutoring system for the next generation learning environment by affiliating proper emotion recognition channels, along with computational intelligence approaches. Finally, this study concludes with research challenges and possible future directions and trends.",

      "abstract": "The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought significant transformation to the field of education. This study aims to review the impact of AI on learning innovation through a literature analysis. The findings indicate that AI contributes to the personalization of learning, operational efficiency, and the enhancement of educational accessibility. Technologies such as educational chatbots, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), and adaptive learning platforms create more interactive and effective learning experiences. However, the implementation of AI also faces challenges related to ethics, data privacy protection, the digital divide, potential algorithmic bias, and educators' readiness. Nevertheless, the role of teachers remains crucial in guiding students and fostering character values. The transformation of learning models through AI opens opportunities to create more inclusive and effective educational experiences, capable of transcending traditional boundaries and providing students worldwide with access to knowledge and skills relevant to contemporary developments.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent tutors have proven to be effective in K-12 education, though their impact on adult learners -- especially as a supplementary resource -- remains underexplored. Understanding how adults voluntarily engage with educational technologies can inform the design of tools that support skill re-learning and enhancement. More critically, it helps determine whether tutoring systems, which are typically built for K-12 learners, can also support adult populations. This study examines the adoption, usage patterns, and effectiveness of a novel tutoring system, Apprentice Tutors, among adult learners at a state technical college. We analyze three types of data including, user demographics, grades, and tutor interactions, to assess whether voluntary tutor usage translates into measurable learning gains. Our findings reveal key temporal patterns in tutor engagement and provide evidence of learning within tutors, as determined through skill improvement in knowledge components across tutors. We also found evidence that this learning transferred outside the tutor, as observed through higher course assessment scores following tutor usage. These results suggest that intelligent tutors are a viable tool for adult learners, warranting further research into their long-term impact on this population.",

      "abstract": "Learning to derive subgoals reduces the gap between experts and students and makes students prepared for future problem solving. Researchers have explored subgoal-labeled instructional materials in traditional problem solving and within tutoring systems to help novices learn to subgoal. However, only a little research is found on problem-solving strategies in relationship with subgoal learning. Also, these strategies are under-explored within computer-based tutors and learning environments. The backward problem-solving strategy is closely related to the process of subgoaling, where problem solving iteratively refines the goal into a new subgoal to reduce difficulty. In this paper, we explore a training strategy for backward strategy learning within an intelligent logic tutor that teaches logic-proof construction. The training session involved backward worked examples (BWE) and problem solving (BPS) to help students learn backward strategy towards improving their subgoaling and problem-solving skills. To evaluate the training strategy, we analyzed students\u2019 1) experience with and engagement in learning backward strategy, 2) performance and 3) proof construction approaches in new problems that they solved independently without tutor help after each level of training and in posttest. Our results showed that, when new problems were given to solve without any tutor help, students who were trained with both BWE and BPS outperformed students who received none of the treatment or only BWE during training. Additionally, students trained with both BWE and BPS derived subgoals during proof construction with significantly higher efficiency than the other two groups.",

      "abstract": "The integration of Adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in educational settings has emerged as a transformative approach, offering tailored learning experiences that dynamically adapt to individual learners' needs, preferences and skill trajectories. This study explores the design, implementation and impact of AI-driven personalised learning pathways, focusing on their role in fostering skill development and improving educational outcomes. Drawing from advancements in adaptive learning platforms and intelligent tutoring systems, we analysed their mechanisms for real-time feedback, dynamic content delivery and personalised assessment. These systems utilise machine learning algorithms and natural language processing to identify gaps in understanding, recommend optimised learning pathways and adjust instructional strategies, thereby creating a highly responsive and student-centred learning environment. This research highlights key implementations, including the use of AI-enabled learning analytics to predict and address dropout risks, enhance engagement and support diverse learning styles. Notable examples, such as Knewton and DreamBox, illustrate the potential of adaptive learning to bridge educational disparities and promote equity by providing learners with customised resources and feedback. Furthermore, this paper addresses critical challenges, including ethical considerations, data privacy and algorithmic biases and offers a framework for the ethical deployment of AI in educational settings. By aligning adaptive AI systems with pedagogical principles, this study underscores their capacity to augment human instruction, enabling educators to focus on fostering higher-order cognitive skills and critical thinking. This exploration contributes to the growing discourse on AI in education and provides actionable insights for educators, technologists and policymakers. It emphasises the transformative potential of adaptive AI systems in preparing learners for the demands of a rapidly evolving digital economy, while fostering inclusivity and lifelong learning. The findings underscore the urgency of advancing these systems to effectively meet global educational challenges.",

      "abstract": "The pursuit of personalized education has led to the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in developing intelligent tutoring systems. To better understand and adapt to individual student needs, including their misconceptions, LLMs need to be trained on extensive datasets of student-tutor dialogues. Our research uncovers a fundamental challenge in this approach: the ``Student Data Paradox.'' This paradox emerges when LLMs, trained on student data to understand learner behavior, inadvertently compromise their own factual knowledge and reasoning abilities. We investigate this paradox by training state-of-the-art language models on student-tutor dialogue datasets and evaluating their performance across multiple benchmarks. These benchmarks assess various aspects of language model capabilities, including reasoning, truthfulness, and common sense understanding. Our findings reveal significant declines in the models' performance across these diverse benchmarks, indicating a broad impact on their capabilities when trained to model student behavior. Our research makes two primary contributions: (1) empirical demonstration of the Student Data Paradox through quantitative analysis of model performance, and (2) introduction of ``hallucination tokens'' as a mitigation strategy. These tokens, while improving performance, highlight the persistent challenge of balancing accurate student behavior modeling with maintaining the LLM's integrity as an educational tool. This study emphasizes the need for innovative solutions to reconcile the conflicting goals of faithfully understanding diverse student cognition while preserving the model's ability to provide accurate information and guidance.",
