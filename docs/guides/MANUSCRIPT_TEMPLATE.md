## Abstract

### Background
{{BACKGROUND}}

### Objectives
{{OBJECTIVES}}

### Methods
We searched {{DATABASES}} from inception to {{SEARCH_DATE}} for studies investigating {{RESEARCH_QUESTION}}. {{INCLUSION_CRITERIA}}. Two reviewers independently screened {{TOTAL_SCREENED}} records and extracted data from {{TOTAL_INCLUDED}} included studies using AI-assisted extraction with triple-review consensus. We assessed risk of bias using {{ROB_TOOL}} and performed {{META_ANALYSIS_TYPE}} meta-analysis where appropriate.

### Results
{{RESULTS_SUMMARY}}. Meta-analysis of {{N_STUDIES_MA}} studies ({{N_PARTICIPANTS}} participants) showed {{POOLED_EFFECT}}. Heterogeneity was {{HETEROGENEITY}}. {{SUBGROUP_FINDINGS}}.

### Conclusions

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Protocol and Registration

This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered with PROSPERO ({{PROSPERO_ID}}). The protocol is available at {{PROTOCOL_URL}}.

### 2.2 Eligibility Criteria

**Inclusion Criteria:**
{{INCLUSION_CRITERIA_LIST}}

**Exclusion Criteria:**
{{EXCLUSION_CRITERIA_LIST}}

### 2.3 Information Sources

We searched the following databases from inception to {{SEARCH_DATE}}:
{{DATABASE_LIST}}

### 2.4 Search Strategy

{{SEARCH_STRATEGY}}

**Example search (PubMed):**
```
{{PUBMED_QUERY}}
```

### 2.5 Selection Process

Two reviewers ({{REVIEWER_1}}, {{REVIEWER_2}}) independently screened titles and abstracts, followed by full-text review of potentially eligible studies. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or third-party arbitration ({{REVIEWER_3}}). We used AI-assisted dual-review screening with automatic conflict detection.

### 2.6 Data Collection Process

Data extraction was performed using AI-powered extraction with triple-review consensus (extraction quality: {{EXTRACTION_QUALITY}}). Each study was independently extracted by three AI reviewers with different temperature parameters (0.2, 0.5, 0.8), and conflicts were resolved through majority voting. Fields with <70% confidence were flagged for human review.

### 2.7 Data Items

We extracted the following data items:
{{DATA_ITEMS_LIST}}

### 2.8 Study Risk of Bias Assessment

Risk of bias was assessed using {{ROB_TOOL}} by two independent reviewers. Disagreements were resolved through consensus.

### 2.9 Effect Measures

{{EFFECT_MEASURES}}

### 2.10 Synthesis Methods

We performed {{META_ANALYSIS_TYPE}} meta-analysis using the {{MA_METHOD}} method. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistic and τ². We conducted subgroup analyses for {{SUBGROUP_VARIABLES}}. Sensitivity analyses included leave-one-out analysis and meta-regression.

Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test.

### 4.4 Limitations

{{DISCUSSION_LIMITATIONS}}

The following limitations should be considered:

1. **Risk of Bias:** {{ROB_LIMITATIONS}}
2. **Heterogeneity:** {{HETEROGENEITY_LIMITATIONS}}
3. **Publication Bias:** {{PUBLICATION_BIAS_LIMITATIONS}}
4. **Generalizability:** {{GENERALIZABILITY_LIMITATIONS}}
5. **AI-Assisted Extraction:** While triple-review consensus achieved high quality ({{EXTRACTION_QUALITY}}), {{N_FLAGGED}} extractions were flagged for human review due to low confidence or conflicts.
